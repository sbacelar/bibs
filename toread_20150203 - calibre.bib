    title = "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 2nd Edition",
    author = "John Zelle",
    note = "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems.

    title = "Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R",
    author = "Thomas Lumley",
    note = "**A complete guide to carrying out complex survey analysis using R**

As survey analysis continues to serve as a core component of sociological research, researchers are increasingly relying upon data gathered from complex surveys to carry out traditional analyses. *Complex Surveys* is a practical guide to the analysis of this kind of data using R, the freely available and downloadable statistical programming language. As creator of the specific survey package for R, the author provides the ultimate presentation of how to successfully use the software for analyzing data from complex surveys while also utilizing the most current data from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate the application of survey research methods in these fields.

The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics within survey analysis such as simple and stratified sampling, cluster sampling, linear regression, and categorical data regression. Subsequent chapters delve into more technical aspects of complex survey analysis, including post-stratification, two-phase sampling, missing data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, an emphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and two-phase designs. In addition, the author supplies a unique discussion of epidemiological two-phase designs as well as probability-weighting for causal inference. All of the book's examples and figures are generated using R, and a related Web site provides the R code that allows readers to reproduce the presented content. Each chapter concludes with exercises that vary in level of complexity, and detailed appendices outline additional mathematical and computational descriptions to assist readers with comparing results from various software systems.

*Complex Surveys* is an excellent book for courses on sampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for applied statisticians and practitioners in the social and health sciences who use statistics in their everyday work.

    note = "\#\#\# Product Description

*The Handbook of Rational and Social Choice* provides an overview of issues arising in work on the foundations of decision theory and social choice over the past three decades. Drawing on work by economic theorists mainly, but also with contributions from political science, philosophy and psychology, the collection shows how the related areas of decision theory and social choice have developed in their applications and moved well beyond the basic models of expected utility and utilitarian approaches to welfare economics. 

Containing twenty-three contributions, in many cases by leading figures in their fields, the handbook shows how the normative foundations of economics have changed dramatically as more general and explicit models of utility and group choice have been developed. This is perhaps the first time these developments have been brought together in a manner that seeks to identify and make accessible the recent themes and developments that have been of particular interest to researchers in recent years. The collection will be of particular value to researchers in economics with interests in utility or welfare but it will also be of interest to any social scientist or philosopher interested in theories of rationality or group decision-making.

    note = "\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

Tomasello, codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, shares his theories on how human cooperation evolved and suggests it is a defining characteristic of our species. To test the innate quality of cooperation in human interactions, Tomasello studies the cooperative behavior of preverbal children, generally 12 months to 24 months in age, and compares their behavior to that of apes in similarly structured experiments. The results are remarkable, demonstrating that even preverbal children have a natural predilection to cooperate and help others. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, especially where food is concerned, tend to act in ways that increase their own individual gain. Tomasello's writing is followed by contributions from four other leading scientists—John B. Silk, Carol Dweck, Brian Skyrns and Elizabeth Spelke—whose comments are illuminating, and while they do not fully agree with Tomasello, they all agree that [h]is cutting edge theory and research has altered the face of developmental psychology by merging cognitive and social development, historically quite separate fields. The book (which originated as a lecture series at Stanford) is generally dryly scientific, but the fascinating approach to the question of what makes us human renders this a singularly worthwhile read. *(Oct.)*

    note = "How can social bonds in society be strengthened? How do we learn and develop prosocial behaviour?

This comprehensive textbook provides up-to-date coverage of the social phenomenon of prosocial behaviour, incorporating all the major developments in the fields of developmental and social psychology. The first section identifies different forms of prosocial behaviour, including estimates of prevalence in everyday situations and the controversy between biological and cultural perspectives as explanatory models of prosocial behaviour. The second and third sections focus on learning and development, with emphasis on social learning, responsibility, empathy and guilt. The fourth section explores the prevalence of prosocial behaviour, in particular the situational and personality factors which inhibit urgently needed prosocial behaviour. The final section is devoted to practical applications, such as how to increase the likelihood that people will work as volunteers in community organisations and how to heighten the willingness to offer first aid.

This book will be an invaluable resource for both undergraduate and postgraduate students of social psychology and sociology, as well as anyone with an interest in social services and voluntary organisations.

'The best introduction to Haskell available. There are many paths towards becoming comfortable and competent with the language but I think studying this book is the quickest path. I urge readers of this magazine to recommend Programming in Haskell to anyone who has been thinking about learning the language.' Duncan Coutts, Monad Reader  


'Two groups of people must consider this book. The first is professors interested in rapidly introducing students to fundamental concepts in functional programming. This book, supplemented with online resources and professorial guidance could easily serve as the textbook for a semester-long course on functional programming. The second group is programmers interested in surveying the functional paradigm as quickly as possible.' Journal of Functional Programming

    author = "Barry White",
    note = "If this book provided a set of rules to be learned and applied, writing a thesis might seem pleasingly easy. But, because writing a thesis is seldom easy, the book instead offers a more complex mapping of the process. The purpose is to raise awareness of the critical choices involved in research and thesis writing for both masters and doctorates. Running as a leitmotif throughout is the notion that no conceptual construct can be complete unto itself. Concepts can only be defined in terms of their dynamic relations with other constructs. It is in this context that the three broad methodological categories informing discussion in the book - exegetic, empirical, and qualitative - were adopted for didactic purposes only: at no time are they considered autonomies. Therefore, not only can they be compared in multiple ways, their shared continuities are often as significant as their differences. Nonetheless, as in the case of different disciplines, differing methodological positions have different textual outcomes. Writing a masters' or doctoral thesis is not only an inherently idiosyncratic exercise, it is also epistemic and, in the current intellectual climate, rhetorical. The malleability of the disciplinary and methodological vocabularies used in academic rhetorics reflects the manner in which not only words but also styles of writing evolve to suit particular purposes. For this reason, the style of writing and the words used in a thesis will need to be interrogated with the same informed intensity applied to all other aspects of the research undertaking. Only then, with the drawing of a more complex cognitive map, will a definition incrementally develop of what - in terms of a researcher's own needs - constitutes sound academic discourse.

If you have done some Bayesian modeling, using WinBUGS, and are anxious to take the next steps to more sophisticated modeling and diagnostics, then the book offers a wealth of advice… This is a book that challenges the user in its sophisticated approach toward data analysis in general and Bayesian methods in particular. I am thoroughly excited to have this book in hand to supplement course material and to offer research collaborators and clients at our consulting lab more sophisticated methods to solve their research problems.  
-John Grego, University of South Carolina 

Bayesian Data Analysis is easily the most comprehensive, scholarly, and thoughtful book on the subject, and I think will do much to promote the use of Bayesian methods  
-Prof. David Blackwell, Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley 

Praise for the first edition:  
A tour de force... it is far more than an introductory text, and could act as a companion for a working scientist from undergraduate level through to professional life.  
-Robert Matthews, Aston University, in New Scientist 

an essential reference text for any applied statistician  
-Stephen Brooks, University of Cambridge, in The Statistician 

will contribute to closing the gap between scientists and statisticians  
-Sander Greenland, UCLA, in American Journal of Epidemiology 

an excellent teaching reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses

It contains detailed discussions of economic efficiency, competitive equilibrium, the first and second welfare theorems, the Kuhn-Tucker approach to general equilibrium, the Arrow-Debreu model, and rational expectations equilibrium and the permanent income hypothesis. Truman Bewley also treats optimal growth and overlapping generations models as special cases of the general equilibrium model. He uses the model and the first and second welfare theorems to explain the main ideas of insurance, capital theory, growth theory, and social security. It enables him to present a unified approach to portions of macro- as well as microeconomic theory. The book contains problems sets for most chapters.

    author = "Nate Silver",
    note = "**{"}Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* is The Soul of a New Machine for the 21st century.{"}  
—Rachel Maddow, author of *Drift***  


Nate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair’s breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger—all by the time he was thirty. *The New York Times* now publishes *FiveThirtyEight.com*, where Silver is one of the nation’s most influential political forecasters.  


Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.  


In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.  


Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.  


With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.  


\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

**Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012:** People love statistics. Statistics, however, do not always love them back. *The Signal and the Noise*, Nate Silver's brilliant and elegant tour of the modern science-slash-art of forecasting, shows what happens when Big Data meets human nature. Baseball, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, economics, and polling: In all of these areas, Silver finds predictions gone bad thanks to biases, vested interests, and overconfidence. But he also shows where sophisticated forecasters have gotten it right (and occasionally been ignored to boot). In today's metrics-saturated world, Silver's book is a timely and readable reminder that statistics are only as good as the people who wield them. --*Darryl Campbell*

\#\#\# From Bookforum

Silver doesn't offer one comprehensive theory for what makes a good prediction in his interdisciplinary tour of forecasting. But the book is a useful gloss on the tricky business of making predictions correctly. —Chris Wilson

    title = "Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R",
    author = "Owen Jones and Robert Maillardet and Andrew Robinson",
    note = "Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming.

**An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R** teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. 

Following a natural progression that assumes no prior knowledge of programming or probability, the book is organised into four main sections:

  * **Programming In R** starts with how to obtain and install R (for Windows, MacOS, and Unix platforms), then tackles basic calculations and program flow, before progressing to function based programming, data structures, graphics, and object-oriented code 
  * **A Primer on Numerical Mathematics** introduces concepts of numerical accuracy and program efficiency in the context of root-finding, integration, and optimization 
  * **A Self-contained Introduction to Probability Theory** takes readers as far as the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, equipping them for point and interval estimation
  * **Simulation **teaches how to generate univariate random variables, do Monte-Carlo integration, and variance reduction techniques 

In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them. 

\#\#\# Review

This book is a good resource for someone who wants to learn R and use R for statistical computing and graphics. It will also serve well as a textbook or a reference book for students in a course related to computational statistics.  
—Hon Keung Tony Ng, *Technometrics*, May 2011

… a very coherent and useful account of its chosen subject matter. … The programming section … is more comprehensive than Braun \& Murdoch (2007), but more accessible than Venables \& Ripley (2000). … The book deserves a place on university library shelves … One very useful feature of the book is that nearly every chapter has a set of exercises. There are also plenty of well-chosen examples throughout the book that are used to explain the material. I also appreciated the clear and attractive programming style of the R code presented in the book. I found very little in the way of typos or solecisms. … I can strongly recommend the book for its intended audience. If I ever again have to teach our stochastic modelling course, I will undoubtedly use some of the exercises and examples from **Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R**.  
—David Scott, *Australian \& New Zealand Journal of Statistics*, 2011

It is not often that I think that a statistics text is one that most scientifc statisticians should have in their personal libraries. **Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R** is such a text. … This text provides scientific researchers with a working knowledge of R for both reviewing and for engaging in the statistical evaluation of scientific data. …It is particularly useful for understanding and developing modeling and simulation software. I highly recommend the text, finding it to be one of the most useful books I have read on the subject.  
—*Journal of Statistical Software*, September 2010, Volume 36

The authors have written an excellent introduction to scientific programming with R. Their clear prose, logical structure, well-documented code and realistic examples made the book a pleasure to read. One particularly useful feature is the chapter of cases studies at the end, which not only demonstrates complete analyses but also acts as a pedagogical tool to review and integrate material introduced throughout the book. … I would strongly recommend this book for readers interested in using R for simulations, particularly for those new to scientific programming or R. It is also very student-friendly and would be suitable either as a course textbook or for self-study.  
—*Significance*, September 2009

I think that the techniques of scientific programming presented will soon enable the novice to apply statistical models to real-world problems. The writing style is easy to read and the book is suitable for private study. If you have never read a book on scientific programming and simulation, then I recommend that you start with this one.

Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

*Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python* can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Since its inception, R has become one of the preeminent programs for statistical computing and data analysis. The ready availability of the program, along with a wide variety of packages and the supportive R community make R an excellent choice for almost any kind of computing task related to statistics. However, many users, especially those with experience in other languages, do not take advantage of the full power of R. Because of the nature of R, solutions that make sense in other languages may not be very efficient in R. This book presents a wide array of methods applicable for reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that data. In addition to the built-in functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods presented take advantage of the core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided for common data management tasks.

\#\#\# Review

*{"}Co-author Witten is the author of other well-known books on data mining, and he and his co-authors of this book excel in statistics, computer science, and mathematics. Their in- depth backgrounds and insights are the strengths that have permitted them to avoid heavy mathematical derivations in explaining machine learning algorithms so they can help readers from different fields understand algorithms. I strongly recommend this book to all newcomers to data mining, especially to those who wish to understand the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms.{"}--***INFORMS Journal of Computing**

{"}The third edition of this practical guide to machine learning and data mining is fully updated to account for technological advances since its previous printing in 2005 and is now even more closely aligned with the use of the Weka open source machine learning, data mining and data modeling application. Beginning with an introduction to data mining, the volume explores basic inputs, outputs and algorithms, the implementation of machine learning schemes and in-depth exploration of the many uses of the Weka data analysis software. Numerous illustration, tables and equations are included throughout and additional resources are available through a companion website. Witten, Frank and Hall are academics with the department of computer science at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, the home of the Weka software project.{"}*--Book News, Reference \& Research*

{"}I would recommend this book to anyone who is getting started in either data mining or machine learning and wants to learn how the fundamental algorithms work. I liked that the book slowly teaches you the different algorithms piece by piece and that there are also a lot of examples. I plan on taking a machine learning course this upcoming fall semester and feel that the book gave me great insight that the course will be based on mathematics more than I had originally expected. My favorite part of the book was the last chapter where it explains how you can solve different practical data mining scenarios using the different algorithms. If there were more chapters like the last one, the book would have been perfect. This book might not be that useful if you do not plan on using the Weka software or if you are already familiar with the various machine learning algorithms. Overall, *Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques* is a great book to learn about the core concepts of data mining and the Weka software suite.{"}-- ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes

\#\#\# Review

{"}[A] well-written textbook (2nd ed., 2006; 1st ed., 2001) on data mining or knowledge discovery. The text is supported by a strong outline. The authors preserve much of the introductory material, but add the latest techniques and developments in data mining, thus making this a comprehensive resource for both beginners and practitioners. The focus is data-all aspects. The presentation is broad, encyclopedic, and comprehensive, with ample references for interested readers to pursue in-depth research on any technique. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals/practitioners.{"}--**CHOICE**

{"}This interesting and comprehensive introduction to data mining emphasizes the interest in multidimensional data mining--the integration of online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining. Some chapters cover basic methods, and others focus on advanced techniques. The structure, along with the didactic presentation, makes the book suitable for both beginners and specialized readers.{"}--*ACM's Computing Reviews.com*

We are living in the data deluge age. The *Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques* shows us how to find useful knowledge in all that data. Thise 3rd editionThird Edition significantly expands the core chapters on data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering. The bookIt also comprehensively covers OLAP and outlier detection, and examines mining networks, complex data types, and important application areas. The book, with its companion website, would make a great textbook for analytics, data mining, and knowledge discovery courses.--*Gregory Piatetsky, President, KDnuggets *

Jiawei, Micheline, and Jian give an encyclopaedic coverage of all the related methods, from the classic topics of clustering and classification, to database methods (association rules, data cubes) to more recent and advanced topics (SVD/PCA , wavelets, support vector machines).. Overall, it is an excellent book on classic and modern data mining methods alike, and it is ideal not only for teaching, but as a reference book.-*From the foreword by Christos Faloutsos, Carnegie Mellon University*

*{"}A very good textbook on data mining, this third edition reflects the changes that are occurring in the data mining field. It adds cited material from about 2006, a new section on visualization, and pattern mining with the more recent cluster methods. It's a well-written text, with all of the supporting materials an instructor is likely to want, including Web material support, extensive problem sets, and solution manuals. Though it serves as a data mining text, readers with little experience in the area will find it readable and enlightening. That being said, readers are expected to have some coding experience, as well as database design and statistics analysis knowledge.Two additional items are worthy of note: the text's bibliography is an excellent reference list for mining research; and the index is very complete, which makes it easy to locate information. Also, researchers and analysts from other disciplines--for example, epidemiologists, financial analysts, and psychometric researchers--may find the material very useful.{"}--**Computing Reviews***

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

    note = "**A world-class physicist and a citizen scientist combine forces to teach Physics 101—the DIY way**  


*The Theoretical Minimum* is a book for anyone who has ever regretted not taking physics in college—or who simply wants to know how to think like a physicist. In this unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike most popular physics books—which give readers a taste of what physicists know but shy away from equations or math—Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics, yourself. Based on Susskind’s enormously popular Stanford University-based (and YouTube-featured) continuing-education course, the authors cover the minimum—the theoretical minimum of the title—that readers need to master to study more advanced topics.  


An alternative to the conventional go-to-college method, *The Theoretical Minimum* provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.  


\#\#\# Review

***Wall Street Journal***  
“So what do you do if you enjoyed science at school or college but ended up with a different career and are still wondering what makes the universe tick?.... Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky’s *The Theoretical Minimum* is the book for you. In this neat little book the authors aim to provide the minimum amount of knowledge you need about classical physics…to gain some real understanding of the world…. They do so with great success…. Along the way you get beautifully clear explanations of famously ‘difficult’ things like differential and integral calculus, conservation laws and what physicists mean by symmetries…. Messrs. Susskind and Hrabovsky’s book is a powerful exposition of why science is ‘real’ and a counter to the kind of wishful thinking employed by people who, for whatever reason, reject the scientific worldview.”  


**Science Blogs: Built on Facts**  
“[A] charming and erudite instance of a genre with very few members – a pop-physics book with partial differential equations on a good fraction of the pages…. More impressive still is that the book entirely resists the temptation to skip to the good stuff – quantum mechanics and so on. This is a book which is purely about classical mechanics…. [S]ucceeds admirably in its goal. It presents classical mechanics in all its glory, from forces to Hamiltonians to symmetry and conservation laws, in a casual but detailed style.”  


***Physics World***  
“Very readable. Abstract concepts are well explained….[*The Theoretical Minimum*] provide[s] a clear description of advanced classical physics concepts, and gives readers who want a challenge the opportunity to exercise their brain in new ways.”  


**Not Even Wrong**  
“[Q]uite good…. The style is breezy and colloquial, with lots of nice explanations of some of the basic concepts of physics. It’s wonderful to see Poisson brackets appearing and nicely explained in a popular book destined to be displayed at bookstores everywhere.”  


**Sean Carroll, physicist, California Institute of Technology, and author of *The Particle at the End of the Universe***  
“What a wonderful and unique resource. For anyone who is determined to learn physics for real, looking beyond conventional popularizations, this is the ideal place to start. It gets directly to the important points, with nuggets of deep insight scattered along the way. I'm going to be recommending this book right and left.”

    author = "Michael Laver and Ernest Sergenti",
    note = "Party competition for votes in free and fair elections involves complex interactions by multiple actors in political landscapes that are continuously evolving, yet classical theoretical approaches to the subject leave many important questions unanswered. Here Michael Laver and Ernest Sergenti offer the first comprehensive treatment of party competition using the computational techniques of agent-based modeling. This exciting new technology enables researchers to model competition between several different political parties for the support of voters with widely varying preferences on many different issues. Laver and Sergenti model party competition as a true dynamic process in which political parties rise and fall, a process where different politicians attack the same political problem in very different ways, and where today's political actors, lacking perfect information about the potential consequences of their choices, must constantly adapt their behavior to yesterday's political outcomes.

*Party Competition* shows how agent-based modeling can be used to accurately reflect how political systems really work. It demonstrates that politicians who are satisfied with relatively modest vote shares often do better at winning votes than rivals who search ceaselessly for higher shares of the vote. It reveals that politicians who pay close attention to their personal preferences when setting party policy often have more success than opponents who focus solely on the preferences of voters, that some politicians have idiosyncratic {"}valence{"} advantages that enhance their electability--and much more.

\#\#\# Review

[T]he book is an excellent starting point for everyone interested in party competition and provides food for future agent-based research. (Víctor M. Eguíluz *JASSS*)  


Besides political scientists who are interested in the topic, this book is well suited for any social scientist who looks for an exemplary introduction to basic techniques of simulation-based research. (Johannes Zschache *RMM*) 

\#\#\# From the Inside Flap

{"}Laver and Sergenti argue that politics is best viewed as a complex dynamical system that is neither random nor in equilibrium. Their use of agent-based modeling to better understand the flux of politics will be of great interest to the next generation of modelers seeking to make sense of the wide variety of political systems in the real world.{"}--Norman Schofield, Washington University in St. Louis

{"}Laver and Sergenti present a bold and rigorous new approach to interparty electoral competition. Their results are remarkable and often puzzling, offering plentiful food for thought for modelers, analytical theorists, and empiricists alike. Ignore this book at your peril, or better, read it and become an admirer.{"}--Kaare Strøm, University of California, San Diego

{"}*Party Competition* is an ambitious and pioneering work. Laver and Sergenti present a new methodology for the study of a quite central and traditional problem in political science. This is to my knowledge the first book-length treatise on the evolutionary modeling of party competition.{"}--Hannu Nurmi, author of *Models of Political Economy*

{"}Distinct and important. The tools that Laver and Sergenti bring to bear on computational modeling will start a debate that is long overdue in the social sciences. This is another step forward in developing the methods needed to solve real-world problems that have so far resisted our best efforts.{"}--Scott de Marchi, Duke University

\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

**From the Author: Why Use R for Your Statistical Work?**

As the Cantonese say, *yauh peng, yauh leng*, which means “both inexpensive and beautiful.” Why use anything else?  
R has a number of virtues:

  * It is a public-domain implementation of the widely regarded S statistical language, and the R/S platform is a de facto standard among professional statisticians.
  * It is comparable, and often superior, in power to commercial products in most of the significant senses -- variety of operations available, programmability, graphics, and so on. 
  * It is available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
  * In addition to providing statistical operations, R is a general-purpose programming language, so you can use it to automate analyses and create new functions that extend the existing language features.
  * R includes a library of several thousand user-contributed packages.
  * It incorporates features found in object-oriented and functional programming languages.
  * R is capable of producing beautiful graphics for your presentations, reports or articles.

As improvements in health care and changes in life styles enable retirees to live longer than ever before, the stress on national budgets will increase substantially. In *Social Security Programs and Retirement around the World*, Jonathan Gruber, David A. Wise, and experts in many countries examine the consequences of reforming retirement benefits in a dozen nations.  


Drawing on the work of an international group of noted economists, the editors argue that social security programs provide strong incentives for workers to leave the labor force by retiring and taking the benefits to which they are entitled. By penalizing work, social security systems magnify the increased financial burden caused by aging populations, thus contributing to the insolvency of the system.  This book is a model of comparative analysis that evaluates the effects of illustrative policies for countries facing the impending rapid growth of social security benefits. Its insights will help inform one of the most pressing debates.

    note = "This work aims to foster the interdisciplinary dialogue between mathematicians and socio-economic scientists. Interaction among scholars and practitioners traditionally coming from different research areas is necessary more than ever in order to better understand many real-world problems we face today.   On the one hand, mathematicians need economists and social scientists to better address the methodologies they design in a more realistic way; on the other hand, economists and social scientists need to be aware of sound mathematical modelling tools in order to understand and, ultimately, solve the complex problems they encounter in their research.   With this goal in mind, this work is designed to take into account a multidisciplinary approach that will encourage the transfer of knowledge, ideas, and methodology from one discipline to the other. In particular, the work has three main themes:   Demystifying and unravelling complex systems; Introducing models of individual behaviours in the social and economic sciences; Modelling socio-economic sciences as complex living systems.   Specific tools examined in the work include a recently developed modelling approach using stochastic game theory within the framework of statistical mechanics and progressing up to modeling Darwinian evolution. Special attention is also devoted to social network theory as a fundamental instrument for the understanding of socio-economic systems.​

Coming in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the presidential election, the 2009 stimulus package, and ongoing debates over financial reform and health care reform—Gruber is the author of Massachusetts’ universal coverage plan—the new edition couldn’t be more timely.  


Thoroughly updated, *Public Finance and Public Policy, Third Edition* brings students up to date on the important debates that are dominating today’s policymaking, giving them the basic tools they need to understand fundamental public finance issues now and in the future.

Assuming a world of incomplete markets and asymmetric information, he uses a variety of simple models to illuminate the economic forces that bear on specific social security policy issues. The focus is on the degree of progressivity desirable in social security and the design of incentives to delay retirement beyond the earliest age of eligibility for benefits. Before analyzing these models, Diamond presents introductions to optimal income tax theory and the theory of incomplete markets. He incorporates recent theoretical developments such as time-inconsistent preferences into his analyses and shows that distorting taxes and a measure of progressivity in benefits are desirable. Diamond also discusses social security reform, with a focus on Germany.

Excerpts from Chapter 4 of *The R Book***

**Chapter 4: Level Set Trees and Code**  
Learn how to make a volume plot and a barycenter plot, and calculate level set trees with the algorithm LeafsFirst, which is implemented in function ``leafsfirst''. This function takes as an argument a piecewise constant function object.

**The multimodal 2D example**  


(Click on image to enlarge)

We consider the density shown in the 2D three-modal density, and calculate first a piecewise constant function object representing this function, and then calculate the level set tree.
    
    N<-c(35,35)                      \# size of the grid pcf<-sim.data(N=N,type={"}mulmod{"}) \# piecewise constant function lst.big<-leafsfirst(pcf)         \# level set tree

We may make the volume plot with the command ''plotvolu(lst)''. However, it is faster first to prune the level set tree, and then plot the reduced level set tree. Function ''treedisc'' takes as the first argument a level set tree, as the second argument the original piecewise constant function, and the 3rd argument ''ngrid'' gives the number of levels in the pruned level set tree. We try the number of levels ngrid=100. 
    
    lst<-treedisc(lst.big,pcf,ngrid=100)

Now we may make a volume plot with the function ''plotvolu''.
    
    plotvolu(lst)

We draw barycenter plots with the function ''plotbary''.
    
     plotbary(lst,coordi=2)  \# 2nd coordinate

**Note:** We may find the number and the location of the modes with the ''modecent'' function, which takes as argument a level set tree. Function ''locofmax'' takes as argument a piecewise constant function and calculates the location of the maximum.
    
    modecent(lst) locofmax(pcf)

**The 3D tetrahedron example**  


(Click on image to enlarge) 

We consider the 3-dimensional example. The calculation is much more time consuming this time.
    
    N<-c(32,32,32)                    \# the size of the grid pcf<-sim.data(N=N,type={"}tetra3d{"}) \# piecewise constant function lst.big<-leafsfirst(pcf)             \# level set tree lst<-treedisc(lst.big,pcf,ngrid=200) \# pruned level set tree plotvolu(lst,modelabel=FALSE)        \# volume plot plotvolu(lst,cutlev=0.010,ptext=0.00045,colo=TRUE) \# zooming coordi<-1                   \# coordinate, coordi = 1, 2, 3 plotbary(lst,coordi=coordi,ptext=0.0006) \# barycenter plot

This time we have used parameter ''cutlev'' to make a zoomed volume plot. When this parameter is given, then only the part of the level set tree is shown which is above the value ''cutlev''. Typically it is better to zoom in to the volume plot by cutting the tails of the volume function away. This is achieved by the parameter ''xlim''. We may us for example the following command to make a ``vertically zoomed'' volume plot.
    
    plotvolu(lst,xlim=c(140,220),ptext=0.00045,          colo=TRUE,modelabel=FALSE)

Additional parameters which we have used are the ''modelabel'', which is used to suppress the plotting of the mode labels, ''ptext'', which lifts the mode labels with the given amount, and ''colo'', which colors the graph of the volume function to make a comparison with the barycenter plots easier.

**The 4D pentahedron example**  


(Click on image to enlarge) 

We consider the 4-dimensional example.
    
    N<-c(16,16,16,16)   pcf<-sim.data(N=N,type={"}penta4d{"}) lst.big<-leafsfirst(pcf) lst<-treedisc(lst.big,pcf,ngrid=100) plotvolu(lst,modelabel=F)  \# volume plot plotvolu(lst,cutlev=0.0008,ptext=0.00039,colo=TRUE) \# zooming coordi<-1               \# coordinate, coordi = 1, 2, 3, 4 plotbary(lst,coordi=coordi,ptext=0.0003) \# barycenter plot

{"}In this book, Houston has created a primer on the fundamental abstract ideas of mathematics; the primary emphasis is on demonstrating the many principles and tactics used in proofs. The material is explained in ways that are comprehensible, which will be a great help for people who seem to hit the wall regarding what to do when confronted with the creation of a proof... In this book, Houston takes a systematic and gentle approach to explaining the ideas of mathematics and how tactics of reasoning can be combined with those ideas to generate what would be considered a convincing proof.{"}

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

This volume systematically guides readers through the process of writing scientific papers for submission to peer-reviewed journals, and addressing referees’ responses. Beyond merely listing elements required for successful scientific writing, *A Scientific Approach to Scientific Writing* offers researchers a full framework for constructing papers, starting from brief statements regarding the rationale, objectives, findings and implications of the study. The writing process is illustrated through four exemplar studies of increasing complexity, worked through from title to conclusions.

The book does not focus primarily on grammar, but includes sections on important facets, such as ‘voices’ and tenses. It also addresses problems associated with writing other texts (reports, reviews, emails, social/professional networking communications etc.). Composed (with inputs from numerous senior scientists) by authors who have written, revised or edited more than 4,000 papers, *A Scientific Approach to Scientific Writing* will be essential reading for non-native English-speaking students and researchers of all disciplines, and a valuable resource for those with English as a first language.

Boris Mirkin takes an unconventional approach and introduces the concept of multivariate data summarization as a counterpart to conventional machine learning prediction schemes, utilizing techniques from statistics, data analysis, data mining, machine learning, computational intelligence, and information retrieval.

Innovations following from his in-depth analysis of the models underlying summarization techniques are introduced, and applied to challenging issues such as the number of clusters, mixed scale data standardization, interpretation of the solutions, as well as relations between seemingly unrelated concepts: goodness-of-fit functions for classification trees and data standardization, spectral clustering and additive clustering, correlation and visualization of contingency data.  

The mathematical detail is encapsulated in the so-called “formulation” parts, whereas most material is delivered through “presentation” parts that explain the methods by applying them to small real-world data sets; concise “computation” parts inform of the algorithmic and coding issues. 

Four layers of active learning and self-study exercises are provided: worked examples, case studies, projects and questions.

Following a brief introduction and overview, early chapters cover the basic algebraic relationships of entropy, relative entropy and mutual information, AEP, entropy rates of stochastics processes and data compression, duality of data compression and the growth rate of wealth. Later chapters explore Kolmogorov complexity, channel capacity, differential entropy, the capacity of the fundamental Gaussian channel, the relationship between information theory and statistics, rate distortion and network information theories. The final two chapters examine the stock market and inequalities in information theory. In many cases the authors actually describe the properties of the solutions before the presented problems. 

\#\#\# From the Inside Flap

Elements of Information Theory is an up-to-date introduction to the field of information theory and its applications to communication theory, statistics, computer science, probability theory, and the theory of investment. Covering all the essential topics in information theory, this comprehensive work provides an accessible introduction to the field that blends theory and applications. In step-by-step detail, the authors introduce the basic quantities of entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information and show how they arise as natural answers to questions of data compression, channel capacity, rate distortion, hypothesis testing, information flow in networks, and gambling. In addition, Elements of Information Theory investigates a number of ideas never before covered at this level in a textbook, including:  
* The relationship of the second law of thermodynamics to Markov chains  
* Competitive optimality of Huffman codes  
* The duality of data compression and gambling  
* Lempel Ziv coding  
* Kolmogorov complexity  
* Portfolio theory  
* Inequalities in information theory and their consequences in mathematics  
Complete with numerous illustrations, original problems and historical notes, Elements of Information Theory is a practical reference for communications professionals and statisticians specializing in information theory. It also serves as an excellent introductory text for senior and graduate students taking courses in telecommunications, electrical engineering, statistics, computer science, and economics.

    author = "Kevin P. Murphy",
    note = "Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.

\#\#\# Review

{"}An astonishing machine learning book: intuitive, full of examples, fun to read but still comprehensive, strong and deep! A great starting point for any university student -- and a must have for anybody in the field.{"} **--Jan Peters**, Darmstadt University of Technology; Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems

{"}Kevin Murphy excels at unraveling the complexities of machine learning methods while motivating the reader with a stream of illustrated examples and real world case studies. The accompanying software package includes source code for many of the figures, making it both easy and very tempting to dive in and explore these methods for yourself. A must-buy for anyone interested in machine learning or curious about how to extract useful knowledge from big data.{"} **--John Winn**, Microsoft Research, Cambridge

{"}This is a wonderful book that starts with basic topics in statistical modeling, culminating in the most advanced topics. It provides both the theoretical foundations of probabilistic machine learning as well as practical tools, in the form of Matlab code. The book should be on the shelf of any student interested in the topic, and any practitioner working in the field.{"}**--Yoram Singer**, Google Inc.

{"}This book will be an essential reference for practitioners of modern machine learning. It covers the basic concepts needed to understand the field as whole, and the powerful modern methods that build on those concepts. In *Machine Learning*, the language of probability and statistics reveals important connections between seemingly disparate algorithms and strategies. Thus, its readers will become articulate in a holistic view of the state-of-the-art and poised to build the next generation of machine learning algorithms.{"} **--David Blei**, Princeton University

{"}This comprehensive book should be of great interest to learners and practitioners in the field of machine learning.{"} -- *British Computer Society*

    note = "This innovative text presents computer programming as a unified discipline in a way that is both practical and scientifically sound. The book focuses on techniques of lasting value and explains them precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. The book presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together.After an introduction to programming concepts, the book presents both well-known and lesser-known computation models ({"}programming paradigms{"}). Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency, and relational programming. Specialized models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming, and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel language -- a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer- significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one, thus showing the deep relationships between different models. The kernel languages are defined precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. Because a wide variety of languages and programming paradigms can be modeled by a small set of closely related kernel languages, this approach allows programmer and student to grasp the underlying unity of programming. The book has many program fragments and exercises, all of which can be run on the Mozart Programming System, an Open Source software package that features an interactive incremental development environment.

The book guides the reader through the process of writing science research and will also help with writing a Master's or Doctoral thesis in English. Science writing is much easier than it looks because the structure and language are conventional. The aim of this book is to help the reader discover a template or model for science research writing and then to provide the grammar and vocabulary tools needed to operate that model. There are five units: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion/Conclusion and Abstract. The reader develops a model for each section of the research article through sample texts and exercises; this is followed by a Grammar and Writing Skills section designed to respond to frequently-asked questions as well as a Vocabulary list including examples of how the words and phrases are to be used.

Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding. This edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications. The text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers. A wealth of customizable online course materials for the book can be obtained from Elena Anne Marchisotto (elena.marchisotto@csun.edu) upon request.

\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

We tend to think of mathematics as uniquely rigorous, and of mathematicians as supremely smart. In his introduction to *The Mathematical Experience*, Gian-Carlo Rota notes that instead, {"}a mathematician's work is mostly a tangle of guesswork, analogy, wishful thinking and frustration, and proof ... is more often than not a way of making sure that our minds are not playing tricks.{"} Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh discuss everything from the nature of proof to the Euclid myth, and mathematical aesthetics to non-Cantorian set theory. They make a convincing case for the idea that mathematics is not about eternal reality, but comprises {"}true facts about imaginary objects{"} and belongs among the human sciences. 

\#\#\# Review

{"}This beautifully written book can be recommended to any cultivated person with a certain sophistication of thought, and also to the practicing mathematician who will find here a vantage point from which to make a tour d'horizon of his science.{"} --Publ. Math. Debrecen {"}This is an unusual book, being more a book about mathematics than a mathematics book. It includes mathematical issues, but also questions from the philosophy of mathematics, the psychology of mathematical discovery, the history of mathematics, and biographies of mathematicians, in short, a book about the mathematical experience broadly considered… The book found its way into {"}Much for liberal arts students{"} courses and into education courses directed at future teachers. Term paper topics, essay assignments, problems, computer applications, and suggested readings are included. This new material should greatly enhance the usefulness of this very creative book. The range of topics covered is immense and the contents cannot easily be summarized. The book makes excellent casual reading, would make a good textbook, or could easily be used as a supplement to nearly any course concerned with mathematics.{"} -Zentralblatt Math {"}This is a people-centered book about mathematics, and as such it provides an opportunity to explore fundamental issues that are typically absent from the experience of most college and university students (as well as their teachers). This new edition provides an excellent initiation of students into some of the more challenging aspects of mathematics…The study edition of The Mathematical Experience will help its readers acquire a real understanding of mathematics.{"} -Notices of the AMS {"}Two distinguished mathematicians...have written a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are.

    author = "Martha C. Nussbaum",
    note = "If a country’s Gross Domestic Product increases each year, but so does the percentage of its people deprived of basic education, health care, and other opportunities, is that country really making progress? If we rely on conventional economic indicators, can we ever grasp how the world’s billions of individuals are really managing?

In this powerful critique, Martha Nussbaum argues that our dominant theories of development have given us policies that ignore our most basic human needs for dignity and self-respect. For the past twenty-five years, Nussbaum has been working on an alternate model to assess human development: the Capabilities Approach. She and her colleagues begin with the simplest of questions: What is each person actually able to do and to be? What real opportunities are available to them? 

The Capabilities Approach to human progress has until now been expounded only in specialized works. *Creating Capabilities*, however, affords anyone interested in issues of human development a wonderfully lucid account of the structure and practical implications of an alternate model. It demonstrates a path to justice for both humans and nonhumans, weighs its relevance against other philosophical stances, and reveals the value of its universal guidelines even as it acknowledges cultural difference. In our era of unjustifiable inequity, Nussbaum shows how—by attending to the narratives of individuals and grasping the daily impact of policy—we can enable people everywhere to live full and creative lives.

{"}Presuming no previous background in statistics and described by the author as {"}demanding{"} yet {"}understandable because the material is as intuitive as possible{"} (p. viii), this certainly would be my choice of textbook if I was required to learn mathematical statistics again for a couple of semesters.{"} *Technometrics, August 2004*

{"}This book should be seriously considered as a text for a theoretical statsitics course for non-majors, and perhaps even for majors...The coverage of emerging and important topics is timely and welcomed...you should have this book on your desk as a reference to nothing less than 'All of Statistics.'{"} *Biometrics, December 2004*

{"}Although *All of Statistics* is an ambitious title, this book is a concise guide, as the subtitle suggests....I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in learning something new about statistical inference. There is something here for everyone.{"} *The American Statistician, May 2005*

{"}As the title of the book suggests, ‘All of Statistics’ covers a wide range of statistical topics. … The number of topics covered in this book is vast … . The greatest strength of this book is as a first point of reference for a wide range of statistical methods. … I would recommend this book as a useful and interesting introduction to a large number of statistical topics for non-statisticians and also as a useful reference book for practicing statisticians.{"} (Matthew J. Langdon, Journal of Applied Statistics, Vol. 32 (1), January, 2005)

{"}This book was written specifically to give students a quick but sound understanding of modern statistics, and its coverage is very wide. … The book is extremely well done … .{"} (N. R. Draper, Short Book Reviews, Vol. 24 (2), 2004)

{"}This is most definitely a book about mathematical statistics. It is full of theorems and proofs … . Presuming no previous background in statistics … this certainly would be my choice of textbook if I was required to learn mathematical statistics again for a couple of semesters.{"} (Eric R. Ziegel, Technometrics, Vol. 46 (3), August, 2004)

{"}The author points out that this book is for those who wish to learn probability and statistics quickly … . this book will serve as a guideline for instructors as to what should constitute a basic education in modern statistics. It introduces many modern topics … . Adequate references are provided at the end of each chapter which the instructor will be able to use profitably … .{"} (Arup Bose, Sankhya, Vol. 66 (3), 2004)

{"}The amount of material that is covered in this book is impressive. … the explanations are generally clear and the wide range of techniques that are discussed makes it possible to include a diverse set of examples … . The worked examples are complemented with numerous theoretical and practical exercises … . is a very useful overview of many areas of modern statistics and as such will be very useful to readers who require such a survey.

    author = "Michael Lewis",
    note = "Four years after his \#1 bestseller *The Big Short*, Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street to report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.

*Flash Boys* is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post–financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading—source of the most intractable problems—will have no advantage whatsoever.

The characters in *Flash Boys* are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think “Wall Street guy.” Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world’s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.

The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, *Flash Boys* is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don’t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.

\#\#\# Review

From the reviews:

“Specifically written for non-native speakers of English it will also be very useful for anyone who is a native English speaker too. It is written both for those who have never presented before in English and are very nervous at the prospect and those with experience who simply want tips on how to improve their international conference or meeting presentation skills. … I can highly recommend this book which is also reasonably priced.” **(Hashim Hashim and Jane Meijlink, ICS News, Vol. 7 (1), January, 2011)**

“This slim book is aimed at presenters with English as their second language (ESL), and specifically at scientific researchers––an unfortunate choice, as this book has far broader appeal. It provides a great introduction for anyone who must learn the art of presentations and a refresher for experienced presenters. … I can unreservedly recommend this book for ESL presenters, English presenters with ESL audiences, and anyone who needs to learn or polish their presentation skills.” **(Geoff Hart, Technical Communication, Vol. 58 (4), November, 2011)**

“This book, easy to understand, will focus on the issues faced by those non native English speakers. It is designed to help them by providing them with rules and tips on, for instance, gaining and maintaining audience attention, handling questions and answers from the audience as well as highlighting examples taken from real presentations. This guide is thus also highly recommended for trainers in English for academic purposes.” **(ESNA – Bulletin, Issue 83, December, 2011)**

“Wallwork has written a helpful guide for those who struggle with presenting scientific results in person.  The book is mainly intended for scientific speakers for whom English is not their primary language, but is also useful for native English speakers who have never presented before or who want to improve their presentation skills. In addition, I’d like to add that the book is also useful for experienced presenters. 

The book is written as a resource guide and … offers useful and practical advice. …  Every chapter starts with an explanation as to why the point [Wallwork] makes is important. … In the book you’ll find advice on how to effectively use English without getting stuck on difficult words or tortuous constructions, how to create effective and complementary slides, and how you and your slides can combine effectively during your presentation, so that the impact is as memorable as possible.

I … recommend this book for anyone who is seeking to gain confidence as a scientific speaker or who wants to improve his or her presentation skills. Although the ‘Death-by-Powerpoint’ syndrome, characterised by slide after slide filled with formal and long texts…delivered in a monotonous drone … that leaves you feeling sleepy, … is still is ever-present around us, this book could be the right antidote for those who are willing to battle the syndrome.” **(Linda M. Liem, *The Write Stuff – The Journal of the European Medical Writers Association*)**

\#\#\# Review

From the reviews:

“This book is that it focuses not just on how to write each section of a paper … but also on how to write clear, concise, unambiguous English … . It tells the students all kind of things that I have not found in other books on this topic … . I really recommend this book not just to students but also to EAP teachers … . written in a way that can be understood by students with an upper intermediate level of English.” (Louise Sutherland, Amazon, May, 2011)

{"}It may well be that a nine page contents section provokes thoughts of despair, and rightly so in some books, but not so for this book. The contents section in actual fact serves to allow the reader to accurately dip in and out of this book and have a particular question regarding writing research papers answered in a concise and straight forward fashion. The 308 pages are divided into 20 parts and each part is then further divided into sub chapters, each of which is titled with a question or simple statement, e.g., *How should I structure my introduction* or *What tenses should I use?* Most chapters, therefore, are short and to the point and effectively deal with an extremely fine aspect of writing, thus allowing the reader to cherry pick at will. 

Every conceivable aspect of writing is covered in detail, including my own favourite chapter 20:14 *Dealing with rejections*!! Nothing is omitted and everything is dealth with in a very easy to read and succinct format...

This would be a useful book for those starting out on the research trail and for those struggling to get their work published. However, I suspect most of us would benefit from the odd chapter here and there...{"} (ICS News, Volume 7, Issue No 2, July 2011)

\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

A whole book on the lowly sentence? Stanley Fish, America's English Professor, confides that he belongs {"}to the tribe of sentence watchers,{"} and shares his passion and learning through an array of examples from sentence-making masters, among them Milton, James, Dr. King, Sterne, Swift, Salinger, Elmore Leonard, Conrad, and Gertrude Stein. For Fish, language is logic. He stresses how the sentence, regardless of length-whether declarative or embroidered with qualifiers-is a structure of logical relationships. He discusses the all-important opening sentence and closing sentence, especially as the latter can be isolated from its dramatic context to convey full rhetorical effect. The reader is advised to begin with form; with practice, writers can develop three basics of style (subordinating, additive, satiric) that will allow them to make an emotional impact with their words. In the end, the craft of sentence writing is elevated to the very center of our inner lives. Fish plays the opinion card well, though a piling on of example after example, particularly of long sentences drawn from literature or theology, might leave more experienced sentence-makers to cry, {"}Enough already!{"}

\#\#\# From Booklist

New York Times columnist and college professor Fish appreciates fine sentences the way some people appreciate fine wine. In 10 short chapters, Fish takes readers through a cogent analysis of how to craft a sentence. He talks about form, content, and style, always taking care to illustrate his points with an ample selection of judicously chosen quotations from virtuoso writers, from Milton and Shakepeare to Anton Scalia and Elmore Leonard. He then proceeds to drill down into the quotations, zeroing in on the tense, parts of speech, or precise phrasing that make the sentences sing. He also discusses famous first and last lines, always keeping in the forefront the extraordinary power of language to shape reality. And, befitting his subject matter, he does all this in the most luminous prose. He fluidly conveys the nitty-gritty details of crafting sentences, but, even more impressive, he communicates and instills in readers a deep appreciation for beautiful sentences that “do things the language you use every day would not have seemed capable of doing.” Language lovers will flock to this homage to great writing. --Joanne Wilkinson

    title = "The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century",
    author = "Alex Ross",
    note = "\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

Anyone who has ever gamely tried and failed to absorb, enjoy, and--especially--understand the complex works of Schoenberg, Mahler, Strauss, or even Philip Glass will allow themselves a wry smile reading *New Yorker* music critic Alex Ross's outstanding *The Rest Is Noise*. Not only does Ross manage to give historical, biographical, and social context to 20th-century pieces both major and minor, he brings the scores alive in language that's accessible and dramatic.

Take Ross's description of Schoenberg's Second Quartet, {"}in which he hesitates at a crossroads, contemplating various paths forming in front of him. The first movement, written the previous year, still uses a fairly conventional late-Romantic language. The second movement, by contrast, is a hallucinatory Scherzo, unlike any other music at the time. It contains fragments of the folk song 'Ach, du lieber Augustin'--the same tune that held Freudian significance for Mahler. For Schoenberg, the song seems to represent a bygone world disintegrating; the crucial line is 'Alles ist hin' (all is lost). The movement ends in a fearsome sequence of four-note figures, which are made up of fourths separated by a tritone. In them may be discerned traces of the bifurcated scale that begins Salome. But there is no longer a sense of tonalities colliding. Instead, the very concept of a chord is dissolving into a matrix of intervals.{"}

Armed with such a detailed aural roadmap, even a troglodyte--or a heavy metal fan--can explore these pivotal works anew. But it's not all crashing cymbals, honking tubas, and somber Germans stroking their chins. Ross also presents the human dramas (affairs, wars, etc.) behind these sweeping compositions while managing, against the odds, to discuss C-major triads, pentatonic scales, and B-flat dominant sevenths without making our eyes glaze over. And he draws a direct link between the Beatles and Sibelius. It's no surprise that the *New York Times* named *The Rest Is Noise* one of the 10 Best Books of 2007. Music nerds have found their most articulate valedictorian. *--Kim Hughes*

\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

*Starred Review.* Ross, the classical music critic for the *New Yorker*, leads a whirlwind tour from the Viennese premiere of Richard Strauss's *Salome* in 1906 to minimalist Steve Reich's downtown Manhattan apartment. The wide-ranging historical material is organized in thematic essays grounded in personalities and places, in a disarmingly comprehensive style reminiscent of historian Otto Friedrich. Thus, composers who led dramatic lives—such as Shostakovich's struggles under the Soviet regime—make for gripping reading, but Ross treats each composer with equal gravitas. The real strength of this study, however, lies in his detailed musical analysis, teasing out—in precise but readily accessible language—the notes that link Leonard Bernstein's *West Side Story* to Arnold Schoenberg's avant-garde compositions or hint at a connection between Sibelius and John Coltrane. Among the many notable passages, a close reading of Benjamin Britten's opera *Peter Grimes* stands out for its masterful blend of artistic and biographical insight. Readers new to classical music will quickly seek out the recordings Ross recommends, especially the works by less prominent composers, and even avid fans will find themselves hearing familiar favorites with new ears. *(Oct.)*

How can we create social structures that are productive and creative?If the Big Data revolution has a presiding genius, it is MIT’s Alex Pentland. Over years of groundbreaking experiments, he has distilled remarkable discoveries that have become the bedrock of a new scientific field: social physics. This revolutionary science shows that innovation doesn’t come from a few exceptionally bright people, but from the flow of ideas — especially how our social networks spread ideas and turn those ideas into behaviours.Thanks to the rise of smartphones, GPS devices, and the internet, Pentland and his teams can study patterns of information exchange in a social network, without any knowledge of the content of the information. Using this data, they can tell with stunning accuracy how effective that network is, whether it’s a business or an entire city. Pentland shows us how to fine-tune these networks to improve their performance — for instance, by maximising a group’s collective intelligence, or by using social incentives to work through disruptive change.Social Physics will change the way we think about how we learn and how our social groups work — and can be made to work better, at every level of society. It is an entirely new way to look at life itself.

Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man's efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking. 

\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

Risk management, which assumes that future risks can be understood, measured and to some extent predicted, is the focus of this solid, thoroughgoing history. Probability theory, pioneered by 17th-century French mathematicians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, has made possible the design of great bridges, electric power utilities and insurance policies. The statistical sampling methods invented by dour Swiss scientist Jacob Bernoulli undergird diverse activities such as the testing of new drugs, stock-picking and wine tasting. Bernstein (Capital Ideas) animates his narrative with a colorful cast of risk-analyzers, including gambling addict Girolamo Cardano, 16th-century Italian physician to the Pope; and John Maynard Keynes, whose concerns over economic uncertainty compelled him to recommend an active, interventionist role for government. Bernstein also traces the development of business forecasting, game theory, insurance and derivatives, and surveys recent advances in risk forecasting made possible through chaos theory and by the development of neural networks.

    author = "Jordan Ellenberg",
    note = "**The *Freakonomics *of math**—**a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands**

The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In *How Not to Be Wrong*, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot through with it.

Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?

*How Not to Be Wrong* presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God.

Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how.

\#\#\# From Booklist

*Starred Review* How many home runs can fans expect a league leader to hit after the All Star break? Why is the most handsome man around often the rudest? By exploring questions such as these, Ellenberg breaks through the widespread perception of mathematics as a narrowly academic pursuit, hopelessly irrelevant to the lives of ordinary people. Readers will indeed marvel at how often mathematics sheds unexpected light on economics (assessing the performance of investment advisors), public health (predicting the likely prevalence of obesity in 30 years), and politics (explaining why wealthy individuals vote Republican but affluent states go for Democrats). Relying on remarkably few technical formulas, Ellenberg writes with humor and verve as he repeatedly demonstrates that mathematics simply extends common sense. He manages to translate even the work of theoretical pioneers such as Cantor and Gödel into the language of intelligent amateurs. The surprises that await readers include not only a discovery of the astonishing versatility of mathematical thinking but also a realization of its very real limits. Mathematics, as it turns out, simply cannot resolve the real-world ambiguities surrounding the Bush-Gore cliff-hanger of 2000, nor can it resolve the much larger question of God’s existence. A bracing encounter with mathematics that matters. --Bryce Christensen 

\#\#\# Review

***Kirkus Reviews*:**  
“The author avoids heavy jargon and relies on real-world anecdotes and basic equations and illustrations to communicate how even simple math is a powerful tool….[Ellenberg]writes that, at its core, math is a special thing and produces a feeling of understanding unattainable elsewhere: ‘You feel you’ve reached into the universe’s guts and put your hand on the wire.’ Math is profound, and profoundly awesome, so we should use it well—or risk being wrong….Witty and expansive, Ellenberg’s math will leave readers informed, intrigued and armed with plenty of impressive conversation starters.” 

***Booklist*:**

**Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, Harvard University; author of *How the Mind Works*:**  
“The title of this wonderful book explains what it adds to the honorable genre of popular writing on mathematics. Like Lewis Carroll, George Gamow, and Martin Gardner before him, Jordan Ellenberg shows how mathematics can delight and stimulate the mind. But he also shows that mathematical thinking should be in the toolkit of every thoughtful person—of everyone who wants to avoid fallacies, superstitions, and other ways of being wrong.” 

**Steven Strogatz, Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics, Cornell University, and author, *The Joy of x*:**  
“With math as with anything else, there’s smart, and then there’s street smart. This book will help you be both. Fans of *Freakonomics* and *The Signal and the Noise* will love Ellenberg’s surprising stories, snappy writing, and brilliant lessons in numerical savvy. *How Not to Be Wrong* is sharp, funny, and right.” 

**John Allen Paulos, author of *Innumeracy* and *A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper*:**  
“Through a powerful mathematical lens Jordan Ellenberg engagingly examines real-world issues ranging from the fetishizing of straight lines in the reporting of obesity to the game theory of missing flights, from the relevance to digestion of regression to the mean to the counter-intuitive Berkson’s paradox, which may explain why handsome men don’t seem to be as nice as not so handsome ones. The coverage is broad, but not shallow and the exposition is non-technical and sprightly.” 

**Timothy Gowers:**  
“Jordan Ellenberg is a top mathematician and a wonderful expositor, and the theme of his book is important and timely. *How Not to Be Wrong* is destined to be a classic.” 

**Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of *Plato at the Googleplex*:**  
“Jordan Ellenberg promises to share ways of thinking that are both simple to grasp and profound in their implications, and he delivers in spades. These beautifully readable pages delight and enlighten in equal parts. Those who already love math will eat it up, and those who don’t yet know how lovable math is are in for a most pleasurable surprise.{"} 

**Danica McKellar, actress and bestselling author of *Math Doesn’t Suck* and *Kiss My Math*:**  
{"}Brilliant and fascinating! Ellenberg shows his readers how to magnify common sense using the tools usually only accessible to those who have studied higher mathematics. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in expanding their worldly savviness—and math IQ!{"}

    author = "Roland Kupers",
    note = "Complexity science--made possible by modern analytical and computational advances--is changing the way we think about social systems and social theory. Unfortunately, economists' policy models have not kept up and are stuck in either a market fundamentalist or government control narrative. While these standard narratives are useful in some cases, they are damaging in others, directing thinking away from creative, innovative policy solutions. *Complexity and the Art of Public Policy* outlines a new, more flexible policy narrative, which envisions society as a complex evolving system that is uncontrollable but can be influenced. 

David Colander and Roland Kupers describe how economists and society became locked into the current policy framework, and lay out fresh alternatives for framing policy questions. Offering original solutions to stubborn problems, the complexity narrative builds on broader philosophical traditions, such as those in the work of John Stuart Mill, to suggest initiatives that the authors call {"}activist laissez-faire{"} policies. Colander and Kupers develop innovative bottom-up solutions that, through new institutional structures such as for-benefit corporations, channel individuals' social instincts into solving societal problems, making profits a tool for change rather than a goal. They argue that a central role for government in this complexity framework is to foster an ecostructure within which diverse forms of social entrepreneurship can emerge and blossom.

\#\#\# Review

{"}Colander and Kupers reframe the standard public policy debate in terms of complexity theory and describe their approach as evolutionary. . . . The authors provide a strong case that current positions, government control, and market fundamentalism are inadequate to addressing contemporary social problems. . . . Recommended for public policy specialists who seek a qualitative introduction to complexity theory and its application to social issues.{"}--**Jennifer M. Miller, *Library Journal*** 

{"}[G]roundbreaking.{"}--**Sam McNerney, *250 Words***

\#\#\# From the Inside Flap

{"}A much-needed, fresh view of policy. It is based neither on free market ideology nor on heavy government control, but on seeing the economy as an always evolving complex system that can be guided toward desirable outcomes. An important book that will change how policies are made.{"}--**W. Brian Arthur, Santa Fe Institute**

{"}*Complexity and the Art of Public Policy* helps readers understand how politics and business are part of a large sophisticated social system and how the critical issues and transitions of this system can be driven successfully.{"}--**Dick Benschop, president-director of Shell Netherlands and former deputy minister of foreign affairs for the Netherlands**

{"}We live in an increasingly interconnected world that generates hugely wicked problems--managing this complexity will be the hallmark of good governments. In this book, Colander and Kupers show how complexity is relevant to policymaking and present a rich menu of ideas for governments wanting to function better in today's intricate operating environment. It deserves to be read by all policymakers.{"}--**Peter Ho, Centre for Strategic Futures, Singapore**

{"}A blend of common sense, historical knowledge, and the latest developments in complexity theory, this book shows what's wrong with the current policy narrative, and offers an exciting alternative.{"}--**Martin Reeves, director of the BCG Strategy Institute**

{"}This book describes how economics got us stuck into two competing policy narratives, and how complexity provides a new way forward. Policymakers everywhere should read it.{"}--**Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute**

{"}This accessible and well-researched book argues that the world in which our leaders govern has become increasingly complex and interconnected, with the potential for unexpected, harmful events, such as market crashes and political uprisings. Complexity, though, should not be avoided. Properly harnessed, the drivers of complexity can produce constant innovation while maintaining system-level robustness. Achieving those ends requires an understanding of the bottom-up thinking so engagingly presented in this book.{"}**--Scott Page, University of Michigan**

    note = "The underlying idea and motive for the book is that the notion of complexity may humanize the social sciences, may conceive the complex human being as more human, and turn reality as assumed in our doing social science into a more complex, that is a richer reality for all.   
The main focus of this book is on new thinking in complexity, with complexity to be taken as derived from the Latin word complexus: ‘that which is interwoven.’   
The trans-disciplinary approach advocated here will be trans-disciplinary in two ways: firstly, by going beyond the separate disciplines within the fields of both natural sciences and social sciences, and, secondly, by going beyond the separate cultures of the natural sciences and of the social sciences and humanities.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

This book focuses on the development of new thinking in complexity and on the tools needed for this new thinking, i.e. the development of a new language for complexity. This new language is very much about how a nonlinear complex reality is part of real-world complexity. We can start thinking in complexity about the complex topics of our social sciences and humanities by making use of this new language. With the new tools and the new language, it will be possible to deal with the complexity of real-world complexity and to show the promise of harnessing complexity, by turning complexity into effective and advantageous complexity for our social sciences and humanities. It is the very potential of complexity as self-potentiating which makes complexity so beneficial for viewing and doing social sciences. The new tools and the new thinking in complexity may be considered to be the warp and woof of a new science of complexity.

**{"}This book is a systematic, well-written, well-organized text on multivariate analysis packed with intuition and insight . . . There is much practical wisdom in this book that is hard to find elsewhere.{"}  
*—IIE Transactions***

Filled with new and timely content, *Methods of Multivariate Analysis, Third Edition* provides examples and exercises based on more than sixty real data sets from a wide variety of scientific fields. It takes a {"}methods{"} approach to the subject, placing an emphasis on how students and practitioners can employ multivariate analysis in real-life situations.

This *Third Edition* continues to explore the key descriptive and inferential procedures that result from multivariate analysis. Following a brief overview of the topic, the book goes on to review the fundamentals of matrix algebra, sampling from multivariate populations, and the extension of common univariate statistical procedures (including *t*-tests, analysis of variance, and multiple regression) to analogous multivariate techniques that involve several dependent variables. The latter half of the book describes statistical tools that are uniquely multivariate in nature, including procedures for discriminating among groups, characterizing low-dimensional latent structure in high-dimensional data, identifying clusters in data, and graphically illustrating relationships in low-dimensional space. In addition, the authors explore a wealth of newly added topics, including:

  * Confirmatory Factor Analysis
  * Classification Trees
  * Dynamic Graphics
  * Transformations to Normality
  * Prediction for Multivariate Multiple Regression
  * Kronecker Products and Vec Notation

New exercises have been added throughout the book, allowing readers to test their comprehension of the presented material. Detailed appendices provide partial solutions as well as supplemental tables, and an accompanying FTP site features the book's data sets and related SAS® code.

Requiring only a basic background in statistics, *Methods of Multivariate Analysis, Third Edition* is an excellent book for courses on multivariate analysis and applied statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a valuable reference for both statisticians and researchers across a wide variety of disciplines.

* The emphasis throughout is on estimation of effect sizes and confidence intervals, rather than on hypothesis testing.  
* Covers the full range of statistical techniques likely to be need to analyse the data from research projects, including elementary material like t-tests and chi-squared tests, intermediate methods like regression and analysis of variance, and more advanced techniques like generalized linear modelling.  
* Includes numerous worked examples and exercises within each chapter.

By offering simple explanations that by-pass much irrelevant and boring detail, *Philosophical Devices* is able to cover a wealth of material that is normally only available to specialists. 

The book contains four sections, each of three chapters. The first section is about sets and numbers, starting with the membership relation and ending with the generalized continuum hypothesis. The second is about analyticity, a prioricity, and necessity. The third is about probability, outlining the difference between objective and subjective probability and exploring aspects of conditionalization and correlation. The fourth deals with metalogic, focusing on the contrast between syntax and semantics, and finishing with a sketch of Godel's theorem. 

*Philosophical Devices* will be useful for university students who have got past the foothills of philosophy and are starting to read more widely, but it does not assume any prior expertise. All the issues discussed are intrinsically interesting, and often downright fascinating. It can be read with pleasure and profit by anybody who is curious about the technical infrastructure of contemporary philosophy.
