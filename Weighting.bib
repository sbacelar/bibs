@article{Decancq2013,
abstract = {Multidimensional indices are becoming increasingly important instruments to assess the wellbeing of societies. They move beyond the focus on a single indicator and yet they are easy to present and communicate. A crucial step in the construction of a multidimensional index of wellbeing is the selection of the relative weights for the different dimensions. The aim of this article is to study the role of these weights and to critically survey eight different approaches to set them. We categorize the approaches in three classes: data-driven, normative, and hybrid weighting, and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks.

@article{Zhou2010,
abstract = {Composite indicators (CIs) have increasingly been accepted as a useful tool for benchmarking, performance comparisons, policy analysis and public communication in many different fields. Several recent studies show that as a data aggregation technique in CI construction the weighted product (WP) method has some desirable properties. However, a problem in the application of the WP method is the difficulty and subjectivity in determining the weights for sub-indicators. In this paper, we extend the WP method and propose a multiplicative optimization approach to constructing CIs. This approach requires no prior knowledge of the weights for sub-indicators. Instead, the weights are generated by solving a series of multiplicative data envelopment analysis type models that can be transformed into equivalent linear programs. Additional relevant information on the weights, if available, can be incorporated into the proposed models. We apply the proposed approach to the 2005 data of 27 economies in the Asia and the Pacific region in the United Nations' Human Development Index study and present the results. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},
