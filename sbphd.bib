	Abstract = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic$\backslash$neffects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of$\backslash$nthis paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews$\backslash$ntheir effects on R{\&}D and economic growth. This part also discusses$\backslash$nthe distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR$\backslash$nprotection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent$\backslash$nrights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects$\backslash$nof IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions$\backslash$nfrom the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments$\backslash$nhave different effects on R{\&}D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical$\backslash$nevidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection$\backslash$nand innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries$\backslash$nthan for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR$\backslash$nprotection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation$\backslash$nagainst the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.$\backslash$nFinally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level$\backslash$nof protection requires an international coordination (rather than$\backslash$nthe harmonization) of IPR protection.},

	Abstract = {166 countries have some kind of public old age pension. What economic forces create and sustain old age Social Security as a public program? We document some of the internationally and historically common features of Social Security programs including explicit and implicit taxes on labor supply, pay- as-you-go features, intergenerational redistribution, benefits which are increasing functions of lifetime earnings and not means-tested. We partition theories of Social Security into three groups: ``political'', ``efficiency'' and ``narrative'' theories. We explore three political theories in this paper: the majority rational voting model (with its two versions: ``the elderly as the leaders of a winning coalition with the poor'' and the ``once and for all election'' model), the ``time-intensive model of political competition'' and the ``taxpayer protection model''. Each of the explanations is compared with the international and historical facts. A companion paper explores the ``efficiency'' and ``narrative'' theories, and derives implications of all the theories for replacing the typical pay-as-you-go system with a forced savings plan.},

@article{wis2015,
	Abstract = {Many European countries have seen a retrenchment in public social policies over recent decades due to fiscal restrictions and demographic changes. Welfare states are in flux and non-state social policy is promoted in a large number of countries in order to cope with these challenges. In changing welfare states, occupational welfare represents a very important potential compen-sation for retrenchment (Trampusch, 2009). Although the comparative welfare state literature has improved our understanding of retrenchment processes (Obinger et al., 2010; Schludi, 2005; Seeleib-Kaiser, 2008), these studies have focused on public pensions and countries Abstract Studies analysing welfare have previously focused on countries as units. In the course of pension cuts and the increasing importance of occupational welfare, our traditional understanding of a homogeneous welfare state is being challenged. In this article, I distinguish between both economic individual power (employee skills) and political collective power (trade unions), and their relation with different occupational pensions. A combined analysis by both factors is not common, where employee skills and power resources are traditionally treated as separate, rival explanations of public welfare. Combining the 'method of difference' with the 'method of agreement', the article first presents the within-country variety of occupational pensions in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Denmark. Occupational pensions in the same economic sectors across countries are then used as the units of analysis in order to illustrate the plausible determinants of economic individual power and political collective power.},

	Abstract = {In this introduction to the special issue, we review the various debates spurred by Esping-Andersen's The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Tracing its impact since the book's publication in 1990, we show that Three Worlds continues to be the point of reference for comparative welfare state research. A content analysis of articles in the Journal of European Social Policy citing the book indicates that Three Worlds may even have obtained a paradigmatic status and that its claims and findings are often taken for granted rather than challenged. We conclude that Three Worlds has become a classic that is likely to continue to have a major influence on welfare state research in its next 25 years.},

@article{hook2015,
	Abstract = {In response to feminist critics, Esping-Andersen (1999) added family to the state-market nexus by examining the degree of familialism across regimes. In the absence of the state de-familializing care, however, it is difficult to predict work-family arrangements without reference to the overall level of inequality and a family's social location within it. Thus, levels of familialism interact with levels of economic inequality. I build on existing categorizations of how two-parent families combine work and care in European countries by adding an explicit consideration of how these patterns vary within countries by education. I utilize hierarchical clustering with data for 16 countries (2004-2010) from the Luxembourg Income Study and the European Social Survey. In some respects, refining country averages by education lends greater support to the tenets of Three Worlds, but also reveals a Southern European pattern distinguished by inequality in work-family arrangements more characteristic of liberal regimes. Findings also illustrate how countries that polarize between dual full-time and male breadwinner families largely polarize by education.},

@article{gingrich2015,
	Abstract = {The central political claim of Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism is that class actors, through the instruments of the democratic process, can modify capitalism. Where working-class mobilization is strong, left parties have sufficient electoral support in the political arena to alter markets politically in ways that decommodify and thereby empower workers. The decline of traditional class voting, however, has profoundly changed this dynamic of welfare politics. We show that the political support coalition for welfare states has been reconfigured through two processes. On the one hand, the Left may have lost support among the traditional working class, but it has substituted this decline by attracting substantial electoral support among specific parts of the expanding middle class. On the other hand, the welfare support coalition has been stabilized through increasing support for the welfare state among right-wing political parties. We discuss the possible consequences of this middle-class shift' in the welfare support coalition in terms of policy consequences.},

@article{iversen2015a,
	Abstract = {We argue that the welfare state operates very differently in the advanced sectors of modern economies and in the low-skill sectors. Governments are concerned to promote the advanced sectors of their economies in which they have comparative advantage. This is a valence issue not a partisan one. Where companies and employees in advanced sectors co-invest heavily in company-specific skills, then governments will be concerned to maintain insurance infrastructures to underwrite these investments. Hence, in advanced sectors, we see politics for markets in maintaining insurance-based welfare states. In low-skill sectors, redistribution and active labour market policies are partisan issues for legislatures, so here our analysis is in line with Politics against Markets. Effective welfare state policies depend on political coalitions in which the low-skilled are represented. We suggest that those coalitions may be less available just as low-skilled workers are increasingly excluded from post-Fordist collective bargaining coverage. Keywords},

	Abstract = {We integrate dual-process theories of human cognition with evolutionary game theory to study the evolution of automatic and controlled decision-making processes. We introduce a model where agents who make decisions using either automatic or controlled processing compete with each other for survival. Agents using automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire resources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so make more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator equation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled agents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We then extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of the population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater proportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the competitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur, leading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics. Critically, however, these limit cycles only emerge when feedback occurs on a sufficiently long time scale. Our results shed light on the connection between evolution and human cognition, and demonstrate necessary conditions for the rise and fall of rationality.},

	Abstract = {Why should you help a competitor? Why should you contribute to the public good if free riders reap the benefits of your generosity? Cooperation in a competitive world is a conundrum. Natural selection opposes the evolution of cooperation unless specific mechanisms are at work. Five such mechanisms have been proposed: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, spatial selection, multilevel selection, and kin selection. Here we discuss empirical evidence from laboratory experiments and field studies of human interactions for each mechanism. We also consider cooperation in one-shot, anonymous interactions for which no mechanisms are apparent. We argue that this behavior reflects the overgeneralization of cooperative strategies learned in the context of direct and indirect reciprocity: we show that automatic, intuitive responses favor cooperative strategies that reciprocate.},

	Abstract = {Does cooperating require the inhibition of selfish urges? Or does ``rational'' self-interest constrain cooperative impulses? I investigated the role of intuition and deliberation in cooperation by meta-analyzing 67 studies in which cognitive- processing manipulations were applied to economic cooperation games (total N = 17,647; no indication of publication bias using Egger's test, Begg's test, or p-curve). My meta-analysis was guided by the social heuristics hypothesis, which proposes that intuition favors behavior that typically maximizes payoffs, whereas deliberation favors behavior that maximizes one's payoff in the current situation. Therefore, this theory predicts that deliberation will undermine pure cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where there are few future consequences for one's actions, such that cooperating is not in one's self-interest) but not strategic cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where cooperating can maximize one's payoff). As predicted, the meta-analysis revealed 17.3{\%} more pure cooperation when intuition was promoted over deliberation, but no significant difference in strategic cooperation between more intuitive and more deliberative conditions.},

	Abstract = {People often favor members of their own group, while discriminating against members of other groups. Such in-group favoritism has been shown to play an important role in human cooperation. However, in the face of changing conflicts and shifting alliances, it is essential for group identities to be flexible. Using the dictator game from behavioral economics, we demonstrate the remodeling of group identities among supporters of Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. After Clinton's concession in June 2008, Democrats were more generous toward supporters of their own preferred candidate than to supporters of the other Democratic candidate. The bias observed in June persisted into August, and disappeared only in early September after the Democratic National Convention. We also observe a strong gender effect, with bias both appearing and subsiding among men only. This experimental study illustrates a dynamic change in bias, tracking the realignment of real world conflict lines and public efforts to reconstitute group identity. The change in salient group identity we describe here likely contributed to the victory of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.},

	Abstract = {It has been argued that punishment promotes the evolution of cooperation when mutation rates are high (i.e. when agents engage in 'exploration dynamics'). Mutations maintain a steady supply of agents that punish free-riders, and thus free-riders are at a disadvantage. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that free-riders sometimes also pay to punish cooperators. Inspired by these empirical results, theoretical work has explored evolutionary dynamics where mutants are rare, and found that punishment does not promote the evolution of cooperation when this 'anti-social punishment' is allowed. Here we extend previous theory by studying the effect of anti-social punishment on the evolution of cooperation across higher mutation rates, and by studying voluntary as well as compulsory Public Goods Games. We find that for intermediate and high mutation rates, adding punishment does not promote cooperation in either compulsory or voluntary public goods games if anti-social punishment is possible: Mutations generate agents that punish cooperators just as frequently as agents that punish defectors, and these two effects cancel each other out. These results raise questions about the effectiveness of punishment for promoting cooperation when mutations are common, and highlight how decisions about which strategies to include in the strategy set can have profound effects on the resulting dynamics.},

@article{rand2010,
	Abstract = {The evolution of cooperation is one of the great puzzles in evolutionary biology. Punishment has been suggested as one solution to this problem. Here punishment is generally defined as incurring a cost to inflict harm on a wrong-doer. In the presence of punishers, cooperators can gain higher payoffs than non-cooperators. Therefore cooperation may evolve as long as punishment is prevalent in the population. Theoretical models have revealed that spatial structure can favor the co-evolution of punishment and cooperation, by allowing individuals to only play and compete with those in their immediate neighborhood. However, those models have usually assumed that punishment is always targeted at non-cooperators. In light of recent empirical evidence of punishment targeted at cooperators, we relax this assumption and study the effect of so-called 'anti-social punishment'. We find that evolution can favor anti-social punishment, and that when anti-social punishment is possible costly punishment no longer promotes cooperation. As there is no reason to assume that cooperators cannot be the target of punishment during evolution, our results demonstrate serious restrictions on the ability of costly punishment to allow the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. Our results also help to make sense of the empirical observation that defectors will sometimes pay to punish cooperators.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances. Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation. Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c {\textgreater} k, we observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c ≤ k or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction for when cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.},

We used agent-based models to explore group genesis in homogeneous populations and found robust group formation with just two basic principles: reciprocity and transitivity. These emergent groups demonstrated in-group cooperation and out-group defection, even though agents lacked common identity. Group formation increased individual payoffs, and group number and size were robust to varying levels of reciprocity and transitivity.

		  of increasing the flexibility of individual pension
		  take-up. We use an overlapping-generations model with
		  Beveridgean pay-as-you-go pensions and heterogeneous
		  individuals who differ in ability and lifespan. We find
		  that introducing flexible pension take-up can induce a
		  Pareto improvement when the initial pension scheme contains
		  within-cohort redis-tribution and induces early retirement.
		  Such a Pareto improving reform entails the application of
		  uniform actuarial adjustment of pension entitlements based
		  on average lifespan. Introducing actuarial non-neutrality
		  that stimulates later retirement further improves such a
		  flexibility reform.},

	Abstract = {We use an income supplementation experiment we designed in
		  the state of Yucatan in Mexico for residents 70 y and older
		  to evaluate health impacts of additional income. Two cities
		  in the State of Yucatan, Valladolid (treatment) and Motul
		  (control), were selected for the income supplementation
		  experiment. Elderly residents of Valladolid were provided
		  the equivalent of an additional {\$}67 per month, a 44{\%}
		  increase in average household income. We designed a survey
		  given to residents of both cities before and 6 mo after the
		  income supplement about their health and other aspects of
		  overall well-being. Both baseline and follow-up surveys
		  collect self-reported data on health, physical functioning,
		  and biomarkers. Anthropometric measurements for every
		  age-eligible respondent, including height, weight, and
		  waist circumference, were collected. We also collected lung
		  capacity, grip strength, a series of balance tests, and a
		  timed walk. Our results show significant health benefits
		  associated with the additional income. Relative to the
		  control site, there was a statistically significant
		  improvement in lung function and an improvement in memory.
		  These improvements are equivalent to a reduction in age of
		  5-10 y. Residents used their extra income to go to the
		  doctor, buy their medications, and alleviate their hunger.
		  The fear that this extra income could be undone by reduced
		  transfers from other family members or unwise expenditures
		  by the poor elderly appears to be unfounded.},

@article{baggio2014,
	Abstract = {There has been extensive empirical research in recent
		  years pointing to a weak correlation between economic
		  growth and subjective well-being (happiness), at least for
		  developed economies (i.e. the so-called `Easterlin
		  paradox'). Recent findings from the behavioural sciences
		  and happiness literature link this paradoxical relationship
		  to negative externalities on utility imposed by social
		  comparison (i.e. relative income with respect to others)
		  and adaptation (habituation to own income in the past). We
		  believe that the type of economic growth (pro-poor,
		  pro-middle, pro-rich, neutral), in combination with
		  sensitivity to social comparison and past income, is a key
		  determinant of happiness trajectories and future utility
		  levels. With the use of agent-based simulations we examine
		  the long-term dynamics of subjective-well-being by focusing
		  attention on the type of growth process rather than the
		  mere size of income growth. We generally find that
		  pro-middle (and balanced) growth corresponds to much higher
		  levels of long-term happiness in comparison to pro-rich
		  growth.},

	Abstract = {Female old age poverty is affected by family policy
		  reforms which are meant to promote gender equality when
		  young. Using our in house agent based simulation model
		  IFSIM we show that sharing equally the parental leave can
		  increase or reduce poverty among elderly women depending on
		  the macro and behavioural (i.e. labour supply) responses
		  that the reform off-sets. In general, the reform can be
		  good for highly educated women, who will have an incentive
		  to work more full time thanks to their higher earnings,
		  which can compensate any loss in household income due to
		  the man's staying home. For lower educated however, work
		  might not pay as much and a reduction in labour supply
		  might actually ensue (e.g. to reduce childcare costs). This
		  will reduce also their pension rights at retirement.
		  Furthermore, keeping men at home might slow down economic
		  growth, and consequently growth of income pension accounts
		  will be lower. This effect, combined with lower pension
		  contributions (due to reduced labour supply), might result
		  in higher poverty rates for women with lower education,
		  compared to a scenario where the woman takes the whole
		  leave. Other policies, such as more subsidised child care,
		  might be an alternative worth considering to reduce female
		  poverty in old age more evenly across educational levels.

@article{baumard2013,
	Abstract = {What makes humans moral beings? This question can be
		  understood either as a proximate ``how'' question or as
		  an ultimate ``why'' question. The ``how'' question is
		  about the mental and social mechanisms that produce moral
		  judgments and interactions, and has been investigated by
		  psychologists and social scientists. The ``why'' question
		  is about the fitness consequences that explain why humans
		  have morality, and has been discussed by evolutionary
		  biologists in the context of the evolution of cooperation.
		  Our goal here is to contribute to a fruitful articulation
		  of such proximate and ultimate explanations of human
		  morality. We develop an approach to morality as an
		  adaptation to an environment in which individuals were in
		  competition to be chosen and recruited in mutually
		  advantageous cooperative interactions. In this environment,
		  the best strategy is to treat others with impartiality and
		  to share the costs and benefits of cooperation equally.
		  Those who offer less than others will be left out of
		  cooperation; conversely, those who offer more will be
		  exploited by their partners. In line with this mutualistic
		  approach, the study of a range of economic games involving
		  property rights, collective actions, mutual help and
		  punishment shows that participants' distributions aim at
		  sharing the costs and benefits of interactions in an
		  impartial way. In particular, the distribution of resources
		  is influenced by effort and talent, and the perception of
		  each participant's rights on the resources to be
		  distributed.},

	Abstract = {This study analyses the actuarial characteristics of the
		  Italian pension system throughout its transition from
		  defined benefit (DB) to notional defined contribution (NDC)
		  rules, taking into account expected increasing longevity.
		  Computations rely on ad hoc projected cohort mortality
		  tables based on a limit survival scenario depicted by
		  demographic experts. Most workers retiring in the coming
		  years, whose pension is partly computed according to DB
		  rules, will receive more-than-actuarially fair pensions.
		  However, the generosity of the pension system has been
		  significantly reduced for them by a recent reform that
		  tightened early retirement eligibility requirements.
		  Disability benefits remain (extremely) generous when
		  claimed before age (57) 60. Steady-state NDC pensions, due
		  to dynamic efficiency, are less than actuarially fair. They
		  further deviate from actuarial fairness due to the specific
		  rules, based on historical mortality, adopted by the
		  Italian law for computing and updating benefits while
		  facing increasing longevity. Cohort mortality projections
		  should be used to handle longevity changes in NDC
		  schemes.},

@unpublished{borsch-supan2005,
	Abstract = {Population aging and pension reform will have profound
		  effects on international capital markets. First,
		  demographic change alters the time path of aggregate
		  savings within each country. Second this process may be
		  amplified when a pension reform shifts old-age provision
		  towards more pre-funding. Third, while the patterns of
		  population aging are similar in most counries, timing and
		  initial conditions differ substantially. Hence, to the
		  extent that capital is internationally mobile, population
		  aging will induce capital flows between countries. All
		  three effects influence the rate of return to capital and
		  interact with the demand for capital in production and with
		  labor supply. In order to quantify these effects, we
		  develop a computational general equilibrium model. We feed
		  this multi-country overlapping generations model with
		  detailed long-term demographic projections for seven world
		  regions. Our simulations indicate that capital flows from
		  fast-aging regions to the rest of the world will initially
		  be substantial but that trends are reversed when households
		  decumulate savings. We also conclude that closed-economy
		  models of pension reform miss quantitatively important
		  effects of international capital mobility.},

	Abstract = {We study the effects of pension reform in a four-period
		  OLG model for an open economy where hours worked by three
		  active generations, education of the young, the retirement
		  decision of older workers, and aggregate growth, are all
		  endogenous. Within each generation we distinguish
		  individuals with high, medium or low ability to build human
		  capital. This extension allows to investigate also the
		  effects of pension reform on the income and welfare levels
		  of different ability groups. Particular attention goes to
		  the income at old-age and the welfare level of low-ability
		  individuals. Our simulation results prefer an intelligent
		  pay-as-you-go pension system above a fully-funded private
		  system. When it comes to promoting employment, human
		  capital, growth, and aggregate welfare, positive effects in
		  a pay-as-you-go system are the strongest when it includes a
		  tight link between individual labor income (and
		  contributions) and the pension, and when it attaches a high
		  weight to labor income earned as an older worker to compute
		  the pension assessment base. Such a regime does, however,
		  imply welfare losses for the current low-ability
		  generations, and rising inequality in welfare.
		  Complementing or replacing this `intelligent'
		  pay-as-you-go system by basic and/or minimum pension
		  components is negative for aggregate welfare, employment
		  and growth. Better is to maintain the tight link between
		  individual labor income and the pension also for
		  low-ability individuals, but to strongly raise their
		  replacement rate.},

	Abstract = {We compare quantitatively eight stochastic models
		  explaining improvements in mortality rates in England and
		  Wales and in the United States. On the basis of the Bayes
		  Information Criterion (BIC), we find that, for higher ages,
		  an extension of the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD) model that
		  incor- porates a cohort effect fits the England and Wales
		  males data best, while for U.S. males data, the Renshaw and
		  Haberman (RH) extension to the Lee and Carter model that
		  also allows for a cohort effect provides the best fit.
		  However, we identify problems with the robustness of
		  parameter estimates under the RH model, calling into
		  question its suitability for forecasting. A different ex-
		  tension to the CBD model that allows not only for a cohort
		  effect, but also for a quadratic age effect, while ranking
		  below the other models in terms of the BIC, exhibits
		  parameter stability across different time periods for both
		  datasets. This model also shows, for both datasets, that
		  there have been approximately linear improvements over time
		  in mortality rates at all ages, but that the improvements
		  have been greater at lower ages than at higher ages, and
		  that there are significant cohort effects.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a framework for developing forecasts
		  of future mortality rates. We discuss the suitability of
		  six stochastic mortality models for forecasting future
		  mortality and estimating the density of mortality rates at
		  different ages. In particular, the models are assessed
		  individually with reference to the following qualitative
		  criteria that focus on the plausibility of their forecasts:
		  biological reasonableness; the plausibility of predicted
		  levels of uncertainty in forecasts at different ages; and
		  the robustness of the forecasts relative to the sample
		  period used to fit the model. An important, though
		  unsurprising, conclusion is that a good fit to historical
		  data does not guarantee sensible forecasts. We also discuss
		  the issue of model risk, common to many modelling
		  situations in demography and elsewhere. We find that even
		  for those models satisfying our qualitative criteria, there
		  are significant differences among central forecasts of
		  mortality rates at different ages and among the
		  distributions surrounding those central forecasts. ?? 2011

	Abstract = {We explore the benefits of intergenerational risk-sharing
		  through both private funded pensions and via the public
		  debt. We use a multi-period overlapping generation model
		  with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension
		  pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public
		  debt and variations in the indexation of pension
		  entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of
		  these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio
		  or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The
		  best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded
		  scheme in which both contributions and entitlement
		  indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation
		  instruments. We find that contribution and indexation
		  adjustment policies are substitutes and the same is the
		  case for contribution and tax adjustment policies. By
		  contrast, indexation and tax adjustment policies are
		  complements. We compare different taxation regimes and
		  conclude that a regime in which pension benefits are taxed,
		  while contributions are paid before taxes, is preferred to
		  a regime in which contributions are paid after taxes, but
		  benefits are untaxed. JEL},

	Abstract = {In this paper we aim at providing a theoretical framework
		  to model workers' choice problem of switching between
		  different pension schemes. This choice problem is common in
		  several countries that have reformed their social security
		  system in the last decades. Although with some specific
		  features, such process is currently affecting private
		  sector em- ployees in Italy, since the reform of the TFR
		  mechanism in 2007. This reform basically allows workers to
		  choose between a scheme directly managed by the firms and
		  an external defined contribution scheme. In their decision
		  workers not only have to weight out the different pros and
		  cons that different schemes offer but they also have to
		  consider the effect that their choice exerts on the
		  financial structure of the firm they work in. Once we have
		  formalized this decision problem, we carry out some
		  simulations in order to replicate the Italian data and to
		  shed some light on the outcomes of the Italian reform.},

@article{dedeken2013,
	Abstract = {Privatization entails a number of quite different aspects
		  that overlap only to some extent: (1) responsibility in
		  provision; (2) possibilities of exit from statutory plans;
		  (3) the transfer of the administration and management of
		  schemes from public bodies acting in a unitary
		  non-competitive administrative environment to private
		  sector actors acting in a more fragmented competitive
		  market based environment; (4) the transfer of the risks of
		  retirement from the collective to the individual; and (5)
		  the recommodification' and financialization' of retirement
		  risks. The paper develops a compound index of private
		  pension provision based on a number of quantifiable
		  variables (theoretical replacement rates of public plans,
		  assets of funded pension schemes, private pension
		  expenditure and coverage by private pension plans) that
		  tries to tap into these different aspects. It can be used
		  to empirically categorize the extent to which Organisation
		  for Economic Co-operation and Development ({\{}OECD){\}}
		  countries have privatized their pension provision.},

	Abstract = {We use an overlapping generations model economy with
		  endogenous retirement to study the 2011 and 2013 reforms of
		  the Spanish public pension system. We find that this latest
		  reforms, which extend the number of years os contributions
		  used to compute the pensions, delay the retirement ages,
		  introduce two sustainability factors, and effectively
		  transform the Spanish pay-as-you- go system into a
		  defined-contribution system, succeed in making Spanish
		  pensions sustainable until 2037, but they fail to do so
		  afterwards. The success until 2037 is achieved reducing the
		  real value of the average pension and leaving the many
		  loopholes of the contributivity and the transparency of the
		  system unchanged. This reduction in pensions is progressive
		  and, by 2037, the average pension will be approximately 20
		  percent smaller in real terms than what it would have been
		  under the pension rules prevailing in 2010. The 2013
		  pension reform fails after 2037 because, from that year
		  onwards, approximately 50 percent of the Spanish retirees
		  will be paid the minimum pension, which is exempt from the
		  sustainability factors. We conjecture that further reforms
		  lurk in the future of Spanish pensions. Keywords:},

	Abstract = {Over the past 20. years, macroeconomists have incorporated
		  more and more results from behavioral economics into their
		  models. We argue that doing so has helped fixed
		  deficiencies with standard approaches to modeling the
		  economy-for example, the counterfactual absence of inertia
		  in the standard New Keynesian model of economic
		  fluctuations. We survey efforts to use behavioral economics
		  to improve some of the underpinnings of the New Keynesian
		  model-specifically, consumption, the formation of
		  expectations and determination of wages and employment that
		  underlie aggregate supply, and the possibility of multiple
		  equilibria and asset price bubbles. We also discuss more
		  broadly the advantages and disadvantages of using
		  behavioral economics features in macroeconomic models.

	Abstract = {When pension systems are contrasted it is common to use
		  simplified demographic models, such as overlapping
		  generation models with time-invariant mortality. Breaking
		  with this tradition, we show that for a population with
		  increasing longevity, the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system may
		  be more advantageous than a funded system (FS). Increasing
		  longevity favours the PAYG system because for the workers
		  living longer at retirement than current retirees, it is
		  less costly to fund others' current pensions than their
		  own. At present, the effect amounts to around 15 per cent
		  in terms of the dependency ratio, or six more years at work
		  in the FS, or 1 per cent per annum in terms of the real
		  interest rate. In most developed countries the effect
		  substantially exceeds that of the usually studied
		  biological interest rate.},

@article{fanti2013,
	Abstract = {This study analyses the dynamics of a general equilibrium,
		  overlapping-generations (closed) economy with pay-as-you-go
		  public pensions and tax-financed health investments that
		  affect the retirement time when old. Life of the typical
		  agent is divided between youth (firth period) and old age
		  (second period). The latter period of life is, in turn,
		  divided between work time and retirement time in a
		  proportion contingent on an individual's state of health.
		  We show that: (i) a unique non-trivial steady state exists,
		  and (ii) when the labour income tax rates used to finance
		  health expenditure or public pensions are included in an
		  intermediate range of values, complex dynamics occur when
		  individuals have perfect foresight. This holds because the
		  increase either in the fraction of time spent working when
		  old or disability pensions reduces savings and capital
		  accumulation. In addition, dynamic phenomena such as
		  multiple bubbling structures related to the bifurcation
		  diagram can be observed. Under some general assumptions, we
		  show that the rise in health care expenditure and/or public
		  pensions initially destabilises the steady-state
		  equilibrium and causes complex dynamics but eventually acts
		  as a stabilising device.},

@article{fernandez2012,
	Abstract = {Previous quantitative research regarding the long
		  expansionary era of public pension generosity has relied
		  mainly on aggregate expenditure data, which capture many
		  pension policy dimensions. Yet, the overall level of
		  national pension generosity may differ from the generosity
		  of each important dimension. To improve our understanding
		  of public pension reforms that increase generosity levels,
		  this study examines the introduction of automatic
		  indexation clauses between 1945 and 2000. The paper tests
		  predictions of welfare policy development and policy
		  diffusion theories. Using event history methods, we argue
		  that the inflation rate and the incumbency of Christian
		  democratic parties are the main determinants of these
		  policy reforms. Countries with higher inflation rates and
		  more entrenched Christian democratic parties are more
		  likely to link pensions in payment or past wages considered
		  for initial calculation purposes to an economic index. This
		  suggests that political parties differ in their support for
		  each measure that improves pension generosity depending on
		  its expected redistributive impact.},

		  uncertain mortality, including longevity selection,
		  mortality improvements, and unexpected systematic shocks.
		  Using longitudinal microdata on Australian pensioners, we
		  quantify the extent of longevity selection at both
		  aggregate and scheme level. We also show that as the
		  age-membership structure in a pension scheme matures,
		  scheme-specific longevity selection risk and systematic
		  shocks become quantitatively more important and have larger
		  consequences for plan liabilities than aggregate selection
		  risk or the impact of mortality improvements.},

@article{gabay2012,
	Abstract = {In this article we formulate and solve the optimal design
		  problem of a defined contribution public pension fund, in a
		  highly stylized but still rather general non-stationary
		  framework. We adopt the viewpoint of a benevolent social
		  planner who aims at treating in a fair manner the
		  successive overlapping generations participating to such a
		  long-term mandatory system. Using the approach of El Karoui
		  and Jeanblanc (1998) for the optimal consumption and
		  portfolio choice problem with random income in a complete
		  market, we exhibit a solution to our intertemporal
		  stochastic control problem where each generation receives a
		  fair (lumpsum) retirement benefit: it is proportional to
		  the contributions she has paid during her active worklife
		  and follows a fixed common rule (although her pension value
		  itself may depend on variables only observable at her
		  retirement time). We next relax the assumption that the
		  collective pension system is mandatory and investigate the
		  performance of individual investment plans in the market.
		  Comparing the outcomes of both alternatives, we derive a
		  condition under which the collective fund can be expected
		  to overperform the individual plan. In the special case of
		  a stationary economy, such a possibility has been pointed
		  out by Gollier (2008). In fact this effect results from the
		  possibility for the collective fund to borrow today against
		  contributions of future generations, which allows to
		  implement riskier strategies and may improve its
		  performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	Abstract = {The BRICS countries have made important prog- ress in
		  extending social security coverage. However, much remains
		  to be achieved to realize the goal of comprehensive
		  universal social security protection. Using policy
		  experiences from the BRICS, the article explores the
		  possibility of drawing from existing models of social
		  security provision to design effective policy interventions
		  for universalizing social security. Main principles of a
		  framework for bridging the coverage gap are identified.
		  These principles are then placed in complimen- tary and
		  supplementary relationships to develop a framework for
		  policy interventions to bridge the social security coverage
		  gap and achieve universal social security.},

	Abstract = {Does the supply of a welfare state create its own demand?
		  Many economic scholars studying welfare arrangements refer
		  to Say's law and insinuate a self-destructive welfare
		  state. However, little is known about the empirical
		  validity of these assumptions and hypotheses. We study the
		  dynamic effect of different welfare arrangements on benefit
		  fraud. In particular, we analyze the impact of the welfare
		  state on the respective social norm, i.e. benefit morale.
		  It turns out that a high level of public social
		  expenditures and a high unemployment rate are associated
		  with a small positive (or no) immediate impact on benefit
		  morale, which however is (partly) crowded out by adverse
		  medium and long run effects. In contrast to earlier studies
		  we do not find that younger birth cohorts have lower values
		  of benefit morale. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of

	Abstract = {When will a vote-seeking government pursue unpopular
		  welfare reforms that are likely to cost it votes? Using a
		  game-theoretical model, we show that a government enacts
		  reforms that are unpopular with the median voter during bad
		  economic times, but not during good ones. The key reason is
		  that voters cannot commit to re-elect a government that
		  does not reform during bad times. This voters' commitment
		  problem stems from economic voting, i.e., voters' tendency
		  to punish the government for a poorly performing economy.
		  The voter commitment problem provides an explanation for
		  the empirical puzzle that governments sometimes enact
		  reforms that voters oppose.},

	Abstract = {We argue that the welfare state operates very differently
		  in the advanced sectors of modern economies and in the
		  low-skill sectors. Governments are concerned to promote the
		  advanced sectors of their economies in which they have
		  comparative advantage. This is a valence issue not a
		  partisan one. Where companies and employees in advanced
		  sectors co-invest heavily in company-specific skills, then
		  governments will be concerned to maintain insurance
		  infrastructures to underwrite these investments. Hence, in
		  advanced sectors, we see politics for markets in
		  maintaining insurance-based welfare states. In low-skill
		  sectors, redistribution and active labour market policies
		  are partisan issues for legislatures, so here our analysis
		  is in line with Politics against Markets. Effective welfare
		  state policies depend on political coalitions in which the
		  low-skilled are represented. We suggest that those
		  coalitions may be less available just as low-skilled
		  workers are increasingly excluded from post-Fordist
		  collective bargaining coverage. Keywords},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the motives underlying inter vivos
		  transfers within the family. Moving away from the altruism
		  and exchange hypotheses, we study the endogenous altruism
		  approach in which private transfers are rooted in a
		  purposeful shaping of preferences within the family. Rather
		  than relying on the demonstration effect theory where
		  parents take care of their elders in order to elicit a
		  similar behaviour from their children, we present instead a
		  model of cultural transmission of altruistic values between
		  generations in which individuals can be either altruistic
		  or nonaltruistic with respect to their parents. The
		  predictions of the model are empirically tested using
		  French data that allow us to investigate time-related
		  transfers and attention from middle-aged respondents to
		  their elders. The empirical results are in favour of the
		  cultural transmission of altruism, in that people who
		  support their parents are more likely to be supported by
		  their children. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

		  model of migration decision making which is based on the
		  theory of planned be- havior. It makes use of empirically
		  estimated demographic transition rates and is thus, to our
		  knowledge, the first decision model of migra- tion which is
		  embedded in the life course. Moreover, it is, other than
		  most agent-based models, a continous time model which makes
		  heavy use of survival theory and competing risks. The model
		  description fol- lows the ODD+D (``Overview, Design
		  Concepts, Details + Decisions'') protocol as suggested in
		  [5].},

	Abstract = {Dynamic microsimulation modelling has become a
		  well-established method of forecasting demographic change.
		  This has led to important applications in areas such as
		  estimating future tax revenues and anticipating pension and
		  health costs. These models are complex and costly to
		  implement and this may be one factor that has hampered the
		  more widespread application of microsimulation modelling.
		  This paper reports a study of the feasibility of using a
		  high level scripting language (Netlogo) to implement a
		  dynamic microsimulation model using an initial population
		  drawn from the 1991 British Household Panel survey. The
		  model was validated by running it for a number of simulated
		  years (1991-2005) and then comparing the predicted
		  population against the actual population observed in the
		  BHPS. It was found that NetLogo made a suitable platform
		  for developing a dynamic microsimulation model and the
		  in-built features for manipulating the collection of agents
		  and the graphical user interface have the potential for
		  simplifying some aspects of developing a dynamic
		  microsimulation model.},

		  identify major problems of both types and to indicate
		  alternative reform possibilities to deal with them. At the
		  same time as several governments struggle with such
		  reforms, new demands on the welfare state emerge. Although
		  the basic structure of today's welfare-state arrangements
		  certainly can be kept, the reforms required are
		  sufficiently large to create considerable conflicts across

	Abstract = {This paper undertakes an assessment of a rapidly growing
		  body of economic research on financial literacy. We start
		  with an overview of theoretical research, which casts
		  financial knowledge as a form of investment in human
		  capital. Endogenizing financial knowledge has important
		  implications for welfare, as well as policies intended to
		  enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger
		  population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to establish
		  how much (or how little) people know and identify the least
		  financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed by
		  an examination of the impact of financial literacy on
		  economic decision making in the United States and
		  elsewhere. While the literature is still young, conclusions
		  may be drawn about the effects and consequences of
		  financial illiteracy and what works to remedy these gaps. A
		  final section offers thoughts on what remains to be learned
		  if researchers are to better inform theoretical and
		  empirical models as well as public policy},

	Abstract = {The explanatory model behind Esping-Andersen's
		  `three-regime' typology points to the variance in
		  `political coalition building in the transition from a
		  rural economy to a middle-class society', particularly to
		  whether or not farmers and workers were able to form
		  coalitions during this transition. The article reconsiders
		  the relation between party systems and welfare state
		  regimes. It highlights the systematic variation among
		  European party systems with respect to the electoral
		  success of communist parties. The electoral strength of
		  communist parties is argued to be related to the intensity
		  of past conflicts between the nation-state and the Catholic
		  church in the mono-denominational countries of Europe's
		  south. These conflicts rendered a coalition between pious
		  farmers and the anticlerical worker's movement unthinkable
		  and furthered the radicalization of the left. The article
		  argues that the split on the left explains much of what is
		  distinctive about southern Europe's postwar political
		  economies. },

@incollection{michel2006,
	Abstract = {This chapter surveys intergenerational altruism in
		  neoclassical growth models. It first examines Barro's
		  approach to intergenerational altruism, whereby successive
		  generations are linked by recursive altruistic preferences.
		  Individuals have an altruistic concern only for their
		  children, who in turn also have altruistic feelings for
		  their own children. Through such a recursive relation all
		  generations of a single family (a dynasty) are linked
		  together by a chain of private intergenerational transfers,
		  countervailing any attempt by the government to
		  redistribute resources across generations. This offsetting
		  of public by private transfers operates only if bequests
		  are positive. This is an important qualification to Barro's
		  debt neutrality result. The conditions under which the
		  Ricardian equivalence (debt neutrality) theorem applies are
		  specified. The effectiveness of fiscal policy is further
		  analysed in the context of an economy populated by
		  heterogeneous families differing with respect to their
		  degree of intergenerational altruism. We also examine other
		  forms of dynastic altruism consistent with Barro's
		  recursive definition of altruism, ascending altruism and
		  two-sided altruism. These forms could be expected to
		  deliver debt neutrality unconditionally, as families
		  leaving zero bequests could be families characterised by
		  child-to-parent gift under ascending altruism. We find that
		  this is not the case and no form of dynastic altruism
		  therefore ensures debt neutrality without condition. Even
		  under two-sided altruism there are cases, in which both
		  bequests and gifts are constrained and fiscal policy
		  remains effective. We then review ad hoc forms of altruism
		  and their implications for the debt neutrality results.
		  Only one specific form of ad hoc altruism always guarantees
		  debt neutrality; this form departs from the recursive
		  approach underpinning dynastic altruism, with its objective
		  function being formally equivalent to that of the social
		  planner. Extensions to the fields of education and
		  environmental are presented in a final section.},

	Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new
		  levels of organization. Genomes, cells, multicellular
		  organisms, social insects, and human society are all based
		  on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators
		  forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one
		  another. But natural selection implies competition and
		  therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism
		  is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the
		  evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct
		  reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and
		  group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is
		  derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead
		  to cooperation.},

@book{oecd2015,
	Abstract = {The theme of this fourth edition of Pensions at a Glance
		  is pensions, retirement and life expectancy. Many countries
		  have increased pension ages in the face of population
		  ageing and longer lives. Some have introduced an automatic
		  link between pensions and life expectancy. Improvements to
		  the incentives to work rather than retire are also a common
		  part of recent pension-reform packages. However, ensuring
		  that there are enough jobs for older workers remains a
		  challenge. An in-depth look at these important policy
		  issues is provided by five special chapters on: pension
		  ages, retirement behaviour, pension incentives to retire,
		  the demand for older workers and linking pensions to life
		  expectancy. This edition updates information on the key
		  features of pension provision in OECD countries and
		  provides projections of retirement income for todays
		  workers. It offers an expanded range of 34 indicators,
		  covering the design of national retirement-income
		  provision, pension entitlements, incomes of older people,
		  the finances of pension systems, the demographic and
		  economic context in which pension systems operate and
		  private pensions. More countries are analysed than in
		  previous editions, including four new members of the OECD:
		  Chile, Estonia, Israel and Slovenia. Where possible, data
		  are also provided for the other major economies in the G20:
		  Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi
		  Arabia and South Africa. Along with data on the European
		  Unions 27 member states, this brings to 43 the number of
		  economies covered in the report. About Pensions at a
		  Glance... An extraordinarily useful and careful
		  compilation of pension information for a wide-range of
		  countries, presented in a common format and following a
		  thoughtful structure. The authors have brought
		  cross-national pension comparisons to a new level, and they
		  are to be commended for their intensive efforts. This
		  represents some of the smartest comparative work out there,
		  by people intimately familiar with the nuances and
		  complexities of comparative pension work. --- Olivia
		  Mitchell, Director of the Boettner Centre for Pensions and
		  Retirement Research, Wharton School, University of
		  Pennsylvania},

	Abstract = {The literature on intergenerational conflict and public
		  budgets has shown that the demands of the elderly may crowd
		  out educational spending. We extend this literature to take
		  into account altruism within the family where individuals
		  care about the welfare of family members. The conflicting
		  claims to the public budget will reflect the political
		  strength of age groups, but may also be influenced by
		  whether middle-aged have children or elderly parents in the
		  community. We investigate the role of family altruism using
		  both survey data and demographic and local government
		  budget data in Norway from 1992 to 2004. Family altruism
		  matters for local government spending on primary education,
		  but does not affect spending on old-age care and health
		  services. The old must take care of their own interests
		  themselves.},

@article{rios2005,
	Abstract = {This article analyses the problem of the micro-macro link.
		  Two alternative frameworks have traditionally been offered
		  to account for this relationship - methodological
		  individualism and methodological holism. The author upholds
		  four theses. First, these two alternatives are incapable of
		  accounting for all possible relationships between
		  microsociological regularities and macrosociological
		  generalizations. Second, there are at least three different
		  ways to formalize micro-macro relationships: parallelism,
		  localism and convergentism. Third, high-level and low-level
		  explanations provide radically different kinds of
		  information. Finally, the author explores a possible
		  naturalization of the debate. The article as a whole can be
		  read as a contribution to the problem of social complexity.

	Abstract = {Intergenerational inequality and old-age poverty are
		  salient issues in contemporary China. China's aging
		  population threatens the {\ldots}scal sustainability of its
		  pension system, a key vehicle for intergenerational
		  redistribution. We analyze the positive and normative
		  e¤ects of alternative pension reforms, using a dynamic
		  general equilibrium model that incorporates population
		  dynamics and productivity growth. Although a reform is
		  necessary, delaying its implementation implies large
		  welfare gains for the (poorer) current generations,
		  imposing only small costs on (richer) future gen- erations.
		  In contrast, a fully funded reform harms current
		  generations, with small gains to future generations. High
		  wage growth is key for these results.},

@article{spielauer2011,
	Abstract = {This article introduces microsimulation by presenting its
		  main underlying ideas as well as its main strengths and
		  drawbacks. Microsimulation is currently experiencing a
		  boom, which is driven by three main forces. The first is
		  the increased demand of policy makers for detailed
		  projections and models able to assess distributional and
		  long-term sustainability issues of social security systems.
		  The second is the emergence of new research paradigms with
		  an increased emphasis on individuals within their context,
		  studied from a longitudinal, multilevel perspective. The
		  third concerns technological advances, providing not only
		  the necessary computer power but also the programming tools
		  for model development, accessible to scientists without
		  specialized programming skills. Although static
		  microsimulation models are established tools for policy
		  analysis, dynamic microsimulation has yet to find its way
		  into the methodological toolbox of mainstream social
		  scientists---but the prospects are promising.},

@article{tausch2013,
	Abstract = {Redistribution is an inevitable feature of collective
		  pension schemes and economic experiments have revealed that
		  most people have a preference for redistribution that is
		  not merely inspired by self-interest. However, little is
		  known on how these preferences interact with preferences
		  for different pension schemes. In this paper, we review the
		  experimental evidence on preferences for redistribution and
		  suggest some links to redistribution through pensions. For
		  that purpose we distinguish between three types of
		  situations. The first deals with distributional preferences
		  behind a veil of ignorance. In the second type of
		  situation, individuals make choices in front of the veil of
		  ignorance and know their position. Finally, we discuss
		  situations in which income is determined by interdependent
		  rather than individual choices. In the closing sections of
		  the paper, we discuss whether and how these experimental
		  results speak to the redistribution issues of pensions. For
		  example, do they argue for or against mandatory
		  participation? Should we have less redistribution and more
		  actuarial fairness? How does this depend on the type of
		  redistribution involved?},

	Abstract = {Alternative pension schemes, and early retirement
		  provisions in particular, can produce different effects on
		  retirement behavior, with significant economic
		  consequences. This paper presents new evidence on the
		  effect of different seniority pension reforms, considering
		  the evolution of an agent-based economy in Italy, with
		  heterogeneous workers whose retirement age depends on
		  expected lifetime incomes. Using dynamic aging methods, we
		  examine behavioral changes along proposed pension reform
		  paths. Our model calibrated to replicate the main
		  demographic and economic features and retirement dynamics
		  of the Italian economy - is used to estimate the age of
		  retirement, total pension expenditures, pension benefits
		  and the trend of inequality and poverty among pensioners
		  under different policy scenarios. More precisely, we
		  compare the current state of affairs (B) with a reform
		  proposed by the Italian Welfare Minister (M) and with an
		  early introduction of a mixed regime for seniority pensions
		  (A) according to two limiting retirement behavioral
		  rules. Under the individual rationality hypothesis, M
		  produces slightly higher savings with minor redistributive
		  effects; although it leads to an increase in income
		  concentration, M mitigates poverty problems after 2008. The
		  reform is more effective under family-bounded rationality,
		  but it leads to permanent and more significant increases in
		  income concentration and aggravates the diffusion and
		  intensity of poverty.},

		  modelling, i.e. an upgrade of this branch of models with a
		  pension system. Within the pension block we model both the
		  first pension pillar, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis,
		  and the fully-funded second pillar of the Slovenian pension
		  system. The modelling of the first pension pillar is based
		  on cash flows of the mandatory pension insurance
		  institution, the relationship between the pension base and
		  the pension, and the process of harmonising pension growth
		  to wage growth. The modelling of the second pillar centres
		  on implementation of the liquidity constraint. Use was made
		  of supplementary pension profiles, and the ratio between
		  premia paid and pensions paid out from supplementary
		  pension insurance. The category of total pension was also
		  introduced, and the model ensured that at every point
		  households adjusted the scope of labour supply and their
		  current consumption towards the target total pension. Key},

@article{wiss2015,
	Abstract = {Many European countries have seen a retrenchment in public
		  social policies over recent decades due to fiscal
		  restrictions and demographic changes. Welfare states are in
		  flux and non-state social policy is promoted in a large
		  number of countries in order to cope with these challenges.
		  In changing welfare states, occupational welfare represents
		  a very important potential compen-sation for retrenchment
		  (Trampusch, 2009). Although the comparative welfare state
		  literature has improved our understanding of retrenchment
		  processes (Obinger et al., 2010; Schludi, 2005;
		  Seeleib-Kaiser, 2008), these studies have focused on public
		  pensions and countries Abstract Studies analysing welfare
		  have previously focused on countries as units. In the
		  course of pension cuts and the increasing importance of
		  occupational welfare, our traditional understanding of a
		  homogeneous welfare state is being challenged. In this
		  article, I distinguish between both economic individual
		  power (employee skills) and political collective power
		  (trade unions), and their relation with different
		  occupational pensions. A combined analysis by both factors
		  is not common, where employee skills and power resources
		  are traditionally treated as separate, rival explanations
		  of public welfare. Combining the 'method of difference'
		  with the 'method of agreement', the article first presents
		  the within-country variety of occupational pensions in
		  Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Denmark.
		  Occupational pensions in the same economic sectors across
		  countries are then used as the units of analysis in order
		  to illustrate the plausible determinants of economic
		  individual power and political collective power.},

	Abstract = {High entry barriers might discourage many social
		  scientists from using existing microsimulation software.
		  This article presents the functionality and capabilities of
		  the free and open source R package MicSim which allows
		  performing continuous-time microsimulation at a very
		  fine-grained level from a low level entry point. Hence, the
		  package might also be of interest to people who are new to
		  R. The package implements a generic microsimulation model
		  for a wide range of demographic applications. Its central
		  device is the individual life-course, which is defined by
		  the sequence of states the individual visits over time and
		  the intervals between the transitions from one state to
		  another. The MicSim model is by design a discrete-event
		  simulation model in which a demographic event implies a
		  change in the state of an individual. The considered
		  population is open and life-courses are specified to evolve
		  along three continuous time scales: individual age,
		  calendar time, and the time that an individual has already
		  spent in the current state. The stochastic model of the
		  microsimulation is parameterized with a base population,
		  transition rates, and (if applicable) a population of
		  migrants. Besides stochastic events, the package allows
		  specifying deterministic events such as enrolment of
		  children in elementary school. Example applications
		  illustrate the capabilities of the package.},
