		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  From the reviews:
		  
		  Specifically written for non-native speakers of English
		  it will also be very useful for anyone who is a native
		  English speaker too. It is written both for those who have
		  never presented before in English and are very nervous at
		  the prospect and those with experience who simply want tips
		  on how to improve their international conference or meeting
		  presentation skills. … I can highly recommend this book
		  which is also reasonably priced.” **(Hashim Hashim and
		  Jane Meijlink, ICS News, Vol. 7 (1), January, 2011)**
		  
		  “This slim book is aimed at presenters with English as
		  their second language (ESL), and specifically at scientific
		  researchers––an unfortunate choice, as this book has
		  far broader appeal. It provides a great introduction for
		  anyone who must learn the art of presentations and a
		  refresher for experienced presenters. … I can
		  unreservedly recommend this book for ESL presenters,
		  English presenters with ESL audiences, and anyone who needs
		  to learn or polish their presentation skills.” **(Geoff
		  Hart, Technical Communication, Vol. 58 (4), November,
		  2011)**
		  
		  “This book, easy to understand, will focus on the issues
		  faced by those non native English speakers. It is designed
		  to help them by providing them with rules and tips on, for
		  instance, gaining and maintaining audience attention,
		  handling questions and answers from the audience as well as
		  highlighting examples taken from real presentations. This
		  guide is thus also highly recommended for trainers in
		  English for academic purposes.” **(ESNA – Bulletin,
		  Issue 83, December, 2011)**
		  
		  “Wallwork has written a helpful guide for those who
		  struggle with presenting scientific results in person.
		   The book is mainly intended for scientific speakers for
		  whom English is not their primary language, but is also
		  useful for native English speakers who have never presented
		  before or who want to improve their presentation skills. In
		  addition, I’d like to add that the book is also useful
		  for experienced presenters.
		  
		  The book is written as a resource guide and … offers
		  useful and practical advice. …  Every chapter starts
		  with an explanation as to why the point [Wallwork] makes is
		  important. … In the book you’ll find advice on how to
		  effectively use English without getting stuck on difficult
		  words or tortuous constructions, how to create effective
		  and complementary slides, and how you and your slides can
		  combine effectively during your presentation, so that the
		  impact is as memorable as possible.
		  
		  I … recommend this book for anyone who is seeking to gain
		  confidence as a scientific speaker or who wants to improve
		  his or her presentation skills. Although the
		  ‘Death-by-Powerpoint’ syndrome, characterised by slide
		  after slide filled with formal and long texts…delivered
		  in a monotonous drone … that leaves you feeling sleepy,
		  … is still is ever-present around us, this book could be
		  the right antidote for those who are willing to battle the
		  syndrome.” **(Linda M. Liem, *The Write Stuff – The
		  Journal of the European Medical Writers Association*)**

		  From the reviews:
		  
		  “This book is that it focuses not just on how to write
		  each section of a paper … but also on how to write clear,
		  concise, unambiguous English … . It tells the students
		  all kind of things that I have not found in other books on
		  this topic … . I really recommend this book not just to
		  students but also to EAP teachers … . written in a way
		  that can be understood by students with an upper
		  intermediate level of English.” (Louise Sutherland,
		  Amazon, May, 2011)

		  How can we create social structures that are productive and
		  creative?If the Big Data revolution has a presiding genius,
		  it is MIT’s Alex Pentland. Over years of groundbreaking
		  experiments, he has distilled remarkable discoveries that
		  have become the bedrock of a new scientific field: social
		  physics. This revolutionary science shows that innovation
		  doesn’t come from a few exceptionally bright people, but
		  from the flow of ideas — especially how our social
		  networks spread ideas and turn those ideas into
		  behaviours.Thanks to the rise of smartphones, GPS devices,
		  and the internet, Pentland and his teams can study patterns
		  of information exchange in a social network, without any
		  knowledge of the content of the information. Using this
		  data, they can tell with stunning accuracy how effective
		  that network is, whether it’s a business or an entire
		  city. Pentland shows us how to fine-tune these networks to
		  improve their performance — for instance, by maximising a
		  group’s collective intelligence, or by using social
		  incentives to work through disruptive change.Social Physics
		  will change the way we think about how we learn and how our
		  social groups work — and can be made to work better, at
		  every level of society. It is an entirely new way to look
		  at life itself. ",

		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  If you have done some Bayesian modeling, using WinBUGS, and
		  are anxious to take the next steps to more sophisticated
		  modeling and diagnostics, then the book offers a wealth of
		  advice… This is a book that challenges the user in its
		  sophisticated approach toward data analysis in general and
		  Bayesian methods in particular. I am thoroughly excited to
		  have this book in hand to supplement course material and to
		  offer research collaborators and clients at our consulting
		  lab more sophisticated methods to solve their research
		  problems. -John Grego, University of South Carolina
		  
		  Bayesian Data Analysis is easily the most comprehensive,
		  scholarly, and thoughtful book on the subject, and I think
		  will do much to promote the use of Bayesian methods -Prof.
		  David Blackwell, Department of Statistics, University of
		  California, Berkeley
		  
		  Praise for the first edition: A tour de force... it is far
		  more than an introductory text, and could act as a
		  companion for a working scientist from undergraduate level

  note		= "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical
		  Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher
		  who wants to perform data analysis using linear and
		  nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book
		  introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same
		  time instructing the reader in how to fit these models
		  using available software packages. The book illustrates the
		  concepts by working through scores of real data examples
		  that have arisen from the authors' own applied research,
		  with programming codes provided for each one. Topics
		  covered include causal inference, including regression,
		  poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and
		  instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic
		  regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips
		  regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided
		  throughout. Author resource page:

  author	= "Barry White",
  note		= "If this book provided a set of rules to be learned and
		  applied, writing a thesis might seem pleasingly easy. But,
		  because writing a thesis is seldom easy, the book instead
		  offers a more complex mapping of the process. The purpose
		  is to raise awareness of the critical choices involved in
		  research and thesis writing for both masters and
		  doctorates. Running as a leitmotif throughout is the notion
		  that no conceptual construct can be complete unto itself.
		  Concepts can only be defined in terms of their dynamic
		  relations with other constructs. It is in this context that
		  the three broad methodological categories informing
		  discussion in the book - exegetic, empirical, and
		  qualitative - were adopted for didactic purposes only: at
		  no time are they considered autonomies. Therefore, not only
		  can they be compared in multiple ways, their shared
		  continuities are often as significant as their differences.
		  Nonetheless, as in the case of different disciplines,
		  differing methodological positions have different textual
		  outcomes. Writing a masters' or doctoral thesis is not only
		  an inherently idiosyncratic exercise, it is also epistemic
		  and, in the current intellectual climate, rhetorical. The
		  malleability of the disciplinary and methodological %$
		  vocabularies used in academic rhetorics reflects the manner
		  in which not only words but also styles of writing evolve
		  to suit particular purposes. For this reason, the style of
		  writing and the words used in a thesis will need to be
		  interrogated with the same informed intensity applied to
		  all other aspects of the research undertaking. Only then,
		  with the drawing of a more complex cognitive map, will a
		  definition incrementally develop of what - in terms of a
		  researcher's own needs - constitutes sound academic
		  discourse.",

  author	= "Boris Mirkin",
  note		= "*Core Concepts in Data Analysis: Summarization,
		  Correlation and Visualization*** **provides in-depth
		  descriptions of those data analysis approaches that either
		  summarize data (principal component analysis and
		  clustering, including hierarchical and network clustering)
		  or correlate different aspects of data (decision trees,
		  linear rules, neuron networks, and Bayes rule).
		  
		  Boris Mirkin takes an unconventional approach and
		  introduces the concept of multivariate data summarization
		  as a counterpart to conventional machine learning
		  prediction schemes, utilizing techniques from statistics,
		  data analysis, data mining, machine learning, computational
		  intelligence, and information retrieval.
		  
		  Innovations following from his in-depth analysis of the
		  models underlying summarization techniques are introduced,
		  and applied to challenging issues such as the number of
		  clusters, mixed scale data standardization, interpretation
		  of the solutions, as well as relations between seemingly
		  unrelated concepts: goodness-of-fit functions for
		  classification trees and data standardization, spectral
		  clustering and additive clustering, correlation and
		  visualization of contingency data.  
		  
		  The mathematical detail is encapsulated in the so-called
		  “formulation” parts, whereas most material is delivered
		  through “presentation” parts that explain the methods
		  by applying them to small real-world data sets; concise
		  “computation” parts inform of the algorithmic and
		  coding issues.
		  
		  Four layers of active learning and self-study exercises are
		  provided: worked examples, case studies, projects and
		  questions.

		  error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques,
		  including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods,
		  and variational approximations, are developed alongside

		  The final part of the book describes the state of the art

  note		= "The topic of prosocial behavior (e.g. fairness,
		  solidarity, and altruism) has recently shifted back into
		  the center of attention in a variety of disciplines,
		  ranging from economics across sociology and psychology
		  towards biology. It is now a well-accepted fact in all
		  human sciences that human behavior is not always governed
		  by egotism and selfish motives. Unfortunately, this does
		  not explain why human also act blatantly selfish and are
		  blind to the suffering of others.
		  
		  This book is a response to the quandary. It brings together
		  leading researchers in sociology and psychology to explain
		  human egotism and altruism using not only their area of
		  study but also bringing in research from economics and
		  biology. Since this work brings together the research of
		  many different disciplines, a complete account of
		  solidarity and prosocial behavior is presented.

  note		= "Flaminio Squazzoni, University of Brescia, ItalyMost of
		  the intriguing social phenomena of our time, such as
		  international terrorism, social inequality, and urban
		  ethnic segregation, are consequences of complex forms of
		  agent interaction that are difficult to observe
		  methodically and experimentally. This book looks at a new
		  research stream that makes use of advanced computer
		  simulation modelling techniques to spotlight agent
		  interaction that allows us to explain the emergence of
		  social patterns. It presents a method to pursue analytical
		  sociology investigations that look at relevant social
		  mechanisms in various empirical situations, such as
		  markets, urban cities, and organisations.Agent-Based
		  Computational Sociology: Provides a comprehensive
		  introduction to epistemological, theoretical and
		  methodological features of agent-based modelling in
		  sociology through various discussions and examples.
		  Presents the pros and cons of using agent-based models in
		  sociology. Explores agent-based models in combining
		  quantitative and qualitative aspects, and micro- and macro
		  levels of analysis. Looks at how to pose an agent-based
		  research question, identifying the model building blocks,
		  and how to validate simulation results. Features examples
		  of agent-based models that look at crucial sociology
		  issues. Is supported by an accompanying website featuring
		  data sets and code for the models included in the book.
		  Agent-Based Computational Sociology is written in a common
		  sociological language and features examples of models that
		  look at all the traditional explanatory challenges of
		  sociology. Researchers and graduate students involved in
		  the field of agent-based modelling and computer simulation
		  in areas such as social sciences, cognitive sciences and
		  computer sciences will benefit from this book. ",

  note		= "Haskell is one of the leading languages for teaching
		  functional programming, enabling students to write simpler
		  and cleaner code, and to learn how to structure and reason
		  about programs. This introduction is ideal for beginners:
		  it requires no previous programming experience and all
		  concepts are explained from first principles via carefully
		  chosen examples. Each chapter includes exercises that range
		  from the straightforward to extended projects, plus
		  suggestions for further reading on more advanced topics.
		  The author is a leading Haskell researcher and instructor,
		  well-known for his teaching skills. The presentation is
		  clear and simple, and benefits from having been refined and
		  class-tested over several years. The result is a text that
		  can be used with courses, or for self-learning. Features
		  include freely accessible Powerpoint slides for each
		  chapter, solutions to exercises and examination questions
		  (with solutions) available to instructors, and a
		  downloadable code that's fully compliant with the latest
		  Haskell release.
		  
		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  'The best introduction to Haskell available. There are many
		  paths towards becoming comfortable and competent with the

		  path. I urge readers of this magazine to recommend
		  Programming in Haskell to anyone who has been thinking
		  about learning the language.' Duncan Coutts, Monad Reader
		  
		  'Two groups of people must consider this book. The first is
		  professors interested in rapidly introducing students to
		  fundamental concepts in functional programming. This book,
		  supplemented with online resources and professorial

		  This comprehensive textbook provides up-to-date coverage of
		  the social phenomenon of prosocial behaviour, incorporating
		  all the major developments in the fields of developmental
		  and social psychology. The first section identifies
		  different forms of prosocial behaviour, including estimates
		  of prevalence in everyday situations and the controversy
		  between biological and cultural perspectives as explanatory
		  models of prosocial behaviour. The second and third
		  sections focus on learning and development, with emphasis
		  on social learning, responsibility, empathy and guilt. The
		  fourth section explores the prevalence of prosocial
		  behaviour, in particular the situational and personality
		  factors which inhibit urgently needed prosocial behaviour.
		  The final section is devoted to practical applications,
		  such as how to increase the likelihood that people will
		  work as volunteers in community organisations and how to
		  heighten the willingness to offer first aid.
		  
		  This book will be an invaluable resource for both
		  undergraduate and postgraduate students of social
		  psychology and sociology, as well as anyone with an
		  interest in social services and voluntary organisations.

		  speakers to write science research for publication in
		  English. It is a practical, user-friendly book intended as
		  a fast, do-it-yourself guide for those whose English
		  language proficiency is above intermediate. The approach is
		  based on material developed from teaching graduate students
		  at Imperial College London and has been extensively
		  piloted. The book guides the reader through the process of
		  writing science research and will also help with writing a
		  Master's or Doctoral thesis in English. Science writing is
		  much easier than it looks because the structure and
		  language are conventional. The aim of this book is to help
		  the reader discover a template or model for science
		  research writing and then to provide the grammar and
		  vocabulary tools needed to operate that model. There are
		  five units: Introduction, Methodology, Results,
		  Discussion/Conclusion and Abstract. The reader develops a
		  model for each section of the research article through
		  sample texts and exercises; this is followed by a Grammar
		  and Writing Skills section designed to respond to
		  frequently-asked questions as well as a Vocabulary list
		  including examples of how the words and phrases are to be

  note		= "**The *Freakonomics *of math**—**a math-world superstar
		  unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts
		  its power in our hands**
		  
		  The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of
		  rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned.
		  In *How Not to Be Wrong*, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how
		  terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to
		  abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but
		  rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot
		  through with it.
		  
		  Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the
		  messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of
		  not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and
		  argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see
		  through to the true meaning of information we take for
		  granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does
		  “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents
		  have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And
		  how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?
		  
		  *How Not to Be Wrong* presents the surprising revelations
		  behind all of these questions and many more, using the
		  mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the
		  hard-won insights of the academic community to the
		  layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical
		  threads through a vast range of time and space, from the
		  everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things,
		  baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire,
		  the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance
		  painting, artificial languages, the development of
		  non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse,
		  Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the
		  psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t
		  figure out about you, and the existence of God.
		  
		  Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest
		  theoretical developments to provide those not trained in
		  math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says,
		  is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your
		  common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.”
		  With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand
		  the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be
		  Wrong will show you how.

		  \#\#\# From Booklist
		  
		  *Starred Review* How many home runs can fans expect a
		  league leader to hit after the All Star break? Why is the
		  most handsome man around often the rudest? By exploring
		  questions such as these, Ellenberg breaks through the
		  widespread perception of mathematics as a narrowly academic
		  pursuit, hopelessly irrelevant to the lives of ordinary
		  people. Readers will indeed marvel at how often mathematics
		  sheds unexpected light on economics (assessing the
		  performance of investment advisors), public health
		  (predicting the likely prevalence of obesity in 30 years),
		  and politics (explaining why wealthy individuals vote
		  Republican but affluent states go for Democrats). Relying
		  on remarkably few technical formulas, Ellenberg writes with
		  humor and verve as he repeatedly demonstrates that
		  mathematics simply extends common sense. He manages to
		  translate even the work of theoretical pioneers such as
		  Cantor and Gödel into the language of intelligent
		  amateurs. The surprises that await readers include not only
		  a discovery of the astonishing versatility of mathematical
		  thinking but also a realization of its very real limits.
		  Mathematics, as it turns out, simply cannot resolve the
		  real-world ambiguities surrounding the Bush-Gore
		  cliff-hanger of 2000, nor can it resolve the much larger
		  question of God’s existence. A bracing encounter with
		  mathematics that matters. --Bryce Christensen
		  
		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  ***Kirkus Reviews*:** “The author avoids heavy jargon and
		  relies on real-world anecdotes and basic equations and
		  illustrations to communicate how even simple math is a
		  powerful tool….[Ellenberg]writes that, at its core, math
		  is a special thing and produces a feeling of understanding
		  unattainable elsewhere: ‘You feel you’ve reached into
		  the universe’s guts and put your hand on the wire.’
		  Math is profound, and profoundly awesome, so we should use
		  it well—or risk being wrong….Witty and expansive,
		  Ellenberg’s math will leave readers informed, intrigued
		  and armed with plenty of impressive conversation
		  starters.”

		  translate even the work of theoretical pioneers such as
		  Cantor and Gödel into the language of intelligent
		  amateurs. The surprises that await readers include not only
		  a discovery of the astonishing versatility of mathematical
		  thinking but also a realization of its very real limits.
		  Mathematics, as it turns out, simply cannot resolve the
		  real-world ambiguities surrounding the Bush-Gore
		  cliff-hanger of 2000, nor can it resolve the much larger
		  question of God’s existence. A bracing encounter with
		  mathematics that matters.”
		  
		  **Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology,
		  Harvard University; author of *How the Mind Works*:**
		  “The title of this wonderful book explains what it adds
		  to the honorable genre of popular writing on mathematics.
		  Like Lewis Carroll, George Gamow, and Martin Gardner before
		  him, Jordan Ellenberg shows how mathematics can delight and
		  stimulate the mind. But he also shows that mathematical
		  thinking should be in the toolkit of every thoughtful
		  person—of everyone who wants to avoid fallacies,
		  superstitions, and other ways of being wrong.”
		  
		  **Steven Strogatz, Schurman Professor of Applied
		  Mathematics, Cornell University, and author, *The Joy of
		  x*:** “With math as with anything else, there’s smart,
		  and then there’s street smart. This book will help you be
		  both. Fans of *Freakonomics* and *The Signal and the Noise*
		  will love Ellenberg’s surprising stories, snappy writing,
		  and brilliant lessons in numerical savvy. *How Not to Be
		  Wrong* is sharp, funny, and right.”
		  
		  **John Allen Paulos, author of *Innumeracy* and *A
		  Mathematician Reads the Newspaper*:** “Through a powerful
		  mathematical lens Jordan Ellenberg engagingly examines
		  real-world issues ranging from the fetishizing of straight
		  lines in the reporting of obesity to the game theory of
		  missing flights, from the relevance to digestion of
		  regression to the mean to the counter-intuitive Berkson’s
		  paradox, which may explain why handsome men don’t seem to
		  be as nice as not so handsome ones. The coverage is broad,
		  but not shallow and the exposition is non-technical and
		  sprightly.”
		  
		  **Timothy Gowers:** “Jordan Ellenberg is a top
		  mathematician and a wonderful expositor, and the theme of
		  his book is important and timely. *How Not to Be Wrong* is
		  destined to be a classic.”
		  
		  **Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of *Plato at the
		  Googleplex*:** “Jordan Ellenberg promises to share ways
		  of thinking that are both simple to grasp and profound in
		  their implications, and he delivers in spades. These
		  beautifully readable pages delight and enlighten in equal
		  parts. Those who already love math will eat it up, and
		  those who don’t yet know how lovable math is are in for a
		  most pleasurable surprise.{"

		  panic! This friendly companion will ease your transition to
		  real mathematical thinking. Working through the book you
		  will develop an arsenal of techniques to help you unlock
		  the meaning of definitions, theorems and proofs, solve
		  problems, and write mathematics effectively. All the major
		  methods of proof - direct method, cases, induction,
		  contradiction and contrapositive - are featured. Concrete

		  practice on topics common to many courses such as divisors,
		  Euclidean algorithms, modular arithmetic, equivalence
		  relations, and injectivity and surjectivity of functions.
		  The material has been tested by real students over many
		  years so all the essentials are covered. With over 300
		  exercises to help you test your progress, you'll soon learn
		  how to think like a mathematician.

		  Computation and Machine Learning Series)",
  author	= "Kevin P. Murphy",
  note		= "Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for
		  automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning
		  provides these, developing methods that can automatically
		  detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns
		  to predict future data. This textbook offers a
		  comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field
		  of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic
		  approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering
		  necessary background material on such topics as
		  probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as
		  discussion of recent developments in the field, including
		  conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep
		  learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible
		  style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important
		  algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color
		  images and worked examples drawn from such application
		  domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and
		  robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different
		  heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled
		  model-based approach, often using the language of graphical
		  models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way.
		  Almost all the models described have been implemented in a
		  MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling
		  toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is
		  suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an
		  introductory-level college math background and beginning
		  graduate students.

		  This book is for people who want to learn probability and
		  statistics quickly. It brings together many of the main
		  ideas in modern statistics in one place. The book is
		  suitable for students and researchers in statistics,
		  computer science, data mining and machine learning.
		  
		  This book covers a much wider range of topics than a
		  typical introductory text on mathematical statistics. It
		  includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation,
		  bootstrapping and classification, topics that are usually
		  relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is assumed to
		  know calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous
		  knowledge of probability and statistics is required. The
		  text can be used at the advanced undergraduate and graduate
		  level.

  author	= "Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky",
  note		= "**A world-class physicist and a citizen scientist combine
		  forces to teach Physics 101—the DIY way**
		  
		  *The Theoretical Minimum* is a book for anyone who has ever
		  regretted not taking physics in college—or who simply
		  wants to know how to think like a physicist. In this
		  unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and
		  hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in
		  physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike
		  most popular physics books—which give readers a taste of
		  what physicists know but shy away from equations or
		  math—Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you
		  need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics,
		  yourself. Based on Susskind’s enormously popular Stanford
		  University-based (and YouTube-featured)
		  continuing-education course, the authors cover the
		  minimum—the theoretical minimum of the title—that
		  readers need to master to study more advanced topics.
		  
		  An alternative to the conventional go-to-college method,
		  *The Theoretical Minimum* provides a tool kit for amateur
		  scientists to learn physics at their own pace.
		  
		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  ***Wall Street Journal*** “So what do you do if you
		  enjoyed science at school or college but ended up with a
		  different career and are still wondering what makes the
		  universe tick?.... Leonard Susskind and George
		  Hrabovsky’s *The Theoretical Minimum* is the book for
		  you. In this neat little book the authors aim to provide
		  the minimum amount of knowledge you need about classical
		  physics…to gain some real understanding of the world….
		  They do so with great success…. Along the way you get
		  beautifully clear explanations of famously ‘difficult’
		  things like differential and integral calculus,
		  conservation laws and what physicists mean by
		  symmetries…. Messrs. Susskind and Hrabovsky’s book is a
		  powerful exposition of why science is ‘real’ and a
		  counter to the kind of wishful thinking employed by people
		  who, for whatever reason, reject the scientific
		  worldview.”
		  
		  **Science Blogs: Built on Facts** “[A] charming and
		  erudite instance of a genre with very few members – a
		  pop-physics book with partial differential equations on a
		  good fraction of the pages…. More impressive still is
		  that the book entirely resists the temptation to skip to
		  the good stuff – quantum mechanics and so on. This is a
		  book which is purely about classical mechanics….
		  [S]ucceeds admirably in its goal. It presents classical
		  mechanics in all its glory, from forces to Hamiltonians to
		  symmetry and conservation laws, in a casual but detailed
		  style.”
		  
		  ***Physics World*** “Very readable. Abstract concepts are
		  well explained….[*The Theoretical Minimum*] provide[s] a
		  clear description of advanced classical physics concepts,
		  and gives readers who want a challenge the opportunity to
		  exercise their brain in new ways.”
		  
		  **Not Even Wrong** “[Q]uite good…. The style is breezy
		  and colloquial, with lots of nice explanations of some of
		  the basic concepts of physics. It’s wonderful to see
		  Poisson brackets appearing and nicely explained in a
		  popular book destined to be displayed at bookstores
		  everywhere.”
		  
		  **Sean Carroll, physicist, California Institute of
		  Technology, and author of *The Particle at the End of the
		  Universe*** “What a wonderful and unique resource. For
		  anyone who is determined to learn physics for real, looking
		  beyond conventional popularizations, this is the ideal
		  place to start. It gets directly to the important points,
		  with nuggets of deep insight scattered along the way. I'm
		  going to be recommending this book right and left.”

		  year, but so does the percentage of its people deprived of
		  basic education, health care, and other opportunities, is
		  that country really making progress? If we rely on
		  conventional economic indicators, can we ever grasp how the
		  world’s billions of individuals are really managing?
		  
		  In this powerful critique, Martha Nussbaum argues that our
		  dominant theories of development have given us policies
		  that ignore our most basic human needs for dignity and
		  self-respect. For the past twenty-five years, Nussbaum has
		  been working on an alternate model to assess human
		  development: the Capabilities Approach. She and her
		  colleagues begin with the simplest of questions: What is
		  each person actually able to do and to be? What real
		  opportunities are available to them?
		  
		  The Capabilities Approach to human progress has until now
		  been expounded only in specialized works. *Creating
		  Capabilities*, however, affords anyone interested in issues
		  of human development a wonderfully lucid account of the
		  structure and practical implications of an alternate model.
		  It demonstrates a path to justice for both humans and
		  nonhumans, weighs its relevance against other philosophical
		  stances, and reveals the value of its universal guidelines
		  even as it acknowledges cultural difference. In our era of
		  unjustifiable inequity, Nussbaum shows how—by attending
		  to the narratives of individuals and grasping the daily
		  impact of policy—we can enable people everywhere to live
		  full and creative lives.

  note		= "Party competition for votes in free and fair elections
		  involves complex interactions by multiple actors in
		  political landscapes that are continuously evolving, yet
		  classical theoretical approaches to the subject leave many
		  important questions unanswered. Here Michael Laver and
		  Ernest Sergenti offer the first comprehensive treatment of
		  party competition using the computational techniques of
		  agent-based modeling. This exciting new technology enables
		  researchers to model competition between several different
		  political parties for the support of voters with widely
		  varying preferences on many different issues. Laver and
		  Sergenti model party competition as a true dynamic process
		  in which political parties rise and fall, a process where
		  different politicians attack the same political problem in
		  very different ways, and where today's political actors,
		  lacking perfect information about the potential
		  consequences of their choices, must constantly adapt their
		  behavior to yesterday's political outcomes.
		  
		  *Party Competition* shows how agent-based modeling can be
		  used to accurately reflect how political systems really
		  work. It demonstrates that politicians who are satisfied
		  with relatively modest vote shares often do better at
		  winning votes than rivals who search ceaselessly for higher
		  shares of the vote. It reveals that politicians who pay

		  Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street to report on a
		  high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.
		  
		  *Flash Boys* is about a small group of Wall Street guys who
		  figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for
		  the benefit of insiders and that, post–financial crisis,
		  the markets have become not more free but less, and more
		  controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at
		  different firms, they come to this realization separately;
		  but after they discover one another, the flash boys band
		  together and set out to reform the financial markets. This
		  they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency
		  trading—source of the most intractable problems—will
		  have no advantage whatsoever.
		  
		  The characters in *Flash Boys* are fabulous, each
		  completely different from what you think of when you think
		  “Wall Street guy.” Several have walked away from jobs
		  in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars
		  a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the
		  big banks, the world’s stock exchanges, and
		  high-frequency trading firms as they have never been
		  investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that
		  Wall Street generates profits.
		  
		  The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the
		  financial world may not be good for your blood pressure,
		  because if you have any contact with the market, even a
		  retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in
		  the end, *Flash Boys* is an uplifting read. Here are people
		  who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment
		  where you don’t get paid for that; they have perceived an
		  institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to
		  fix it.

  note		= "\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly
		  
		  Tomasello, codirector of the Max Planck Institute for
		  Evolutionary Anthropology, shares his theories on how human
		  cooperation evolved and suggests it is a defining
		  characteristic of our species. To test the innate quality
		  of cooperation in human interactions, Tomasello studies the
		  cooperative behavior of preverbal children, generally 12
		  months to 24 months in age, and compares their behavior to
		  that of apes in similarly structured experiments. The
		  results are remarkable, demonstrating that even preverbal
		  children have a natural predilection to cooperate and help
		  others. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, especially where
		  food is concerned, tend to act in ways that increase their
		  own individual gain. Tomasello's writing is followed by
		  contributions from four other leading scientists—John B.
		  Silk, Carol Dweck, Brian Skyrns and Elizabeth
		  Spelke—whose comments are illuminating, and while they do
		  not fully agree with Tomasello, they all agree that [h]is
		  cutting edge theory and research has altered the face of
		  developmental psychology by merging cognitive and social
		  development, historically quite separate fields. The book
		  (which originated as a lecture series at Stanford) is
		  generally dryly scientific, but the fascinating approach to
		  the question of what makes us human renders this a
		  singularly worthwhile read. *(Oct.)* Copyright © Reed

  abstract	= {This chapter surveys intergenerational altruism in
		  neoclassical growth models. It first examines Barro's
		  approach to intergenerational altruism, whereby successive
		  generations are linked by recursive altruistic preferences.
		  Individuals have an altruistic concern only for their
		  children, who in turn also have altruistic feelings for
		  their own children. Through such a recursive relation all
		  generations of a single family (a dynasty) are linked
		  together by a chain of private intergenerational transfers,
		  countervailing any attempt by the government to
		  redistribute resources across generations. This offsetting
		  of public by private transfers operates only if bequests
		  are positive. This is an important qualification to Barro's
		  debt neutrality result. The conditions under which the
		  Ricardian equivalence (debt neutrality) theorem applies are
		  specified. The effectiveness of fiscal policy is further
		  analysed in the context of an economy populated by
		  heterogeneous families differing with respect to their
		  degree of intergenerational altruism. We also examine other
		  forms of dynastic altruism consistent with Barro's
		  recursive definition of altruism, ascending altruism and
		  two-sided altruism. These forms could be expected to
		  deliver debt neutrality unconditionally, as families
		  leaving zero bequests could be families characterised by
		  child-to-parent gift under ascending altruism. We find that
		  this is not the case and no form of dynastic altruism
		  therefore ensures debt neutrality without condition. Even
		  under two-sided altruism there are cases, in which both
		  bequests and gifts are constrained and fiscal policy
		  remains effective. We then review ad hoc forms of altruism
		  and their implications for the debt neutrality results.
		  Only one specific form of ad hoc altruism always guarantees
		  debt neutrality; this form departs from the recursive
		  approach underpinning dynastic altruism, with its objective
		  function being formally equivalent to that of the social
		  planner. Extensions to the fields of education and
		  environmental are presented in a final section.},

		  Interaction among scholars and practitioners traditionally

		  we face today.   On the one hand, mathematicians need
		  economists and social scientists to better address the

		  other hand, economists and social scientists need to be
		  aware of sound mathematical modelling tools in order to
		  understand and, ultimately, solve the complex problems they
		  encounter in their research.   With this goal in mind,
		  this work is designed to take into account a
		  multidisciplinary approach that will encourage the transfer
		  of knowledge, ideas, and methodology from one discipline to
		  the other. In particular, the work has three main themes:
		    Demystifying and unravelling complex systems;
		  Introducing models of individual behaviours in the social
		  and economic sciences; Modelling socio-economic sciences as
		  complex living systems.   Specific tools examined in the
		  work include a recently developed modelling approach using
		  stochastic game theory within the framework of statistical
		  mechanics and progressing up to modeling Darwinian
		  evolution. Special attention is also devoted to social
		  network theory as a fundamental instrument for the

		  **From the Author: Why Use R for Your Statistical Work?**
		  
		  As the Cantonese say, *yauh peng, yauh leng*, which means
		  “both inexpensive and beautiful.” Why use anything
		  else? R has a number of virtues:
		  
		  * It is a public-domain implementation of the widely
		  regarded S statistical language, and the R/S platform is a
		  de facto standard among professional statisticians. * It is
		  comparable, and often superior, in power to commercial
		  products in most of the significant senses -- variety of
		  operations available, programmability, graphics, and so on.
		  * It is available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating
		  systems. * In addition to providing statistical operations,
		  R is a general-purpose programming language, so you can use
		  it to automate analyses and create new functions that
		  extend the existing language features. * R includes a
		  library of several thousand user-contributed packages. * It
		  incorporates features found in object-oriented and
		  functional programming languages. * R is capable of
		  producing beautiful graphics for your presentations,
		  reports or articles.

		  Using R",
  author	= "Owen Jones and Robert Maillardet and Andrew Robinson",
  note		= "Known for its versatility, the free programming language R
		  is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but
		  is also a fully functional programming language well suited
		  to scientific programming.
		  
		  **An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation
		  Using R** teaches the skills needed to perform scientific
		  programming while also introducing stochastic modelling.
		  Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical
		  modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific
		  programming because the numerical techniques of scientific
		  programming enable the practical application of
		  mathematical models to real-world problems.
		  
		  Following a natural progression that assumes no prior
		  knowledge of programming or probability, the book is
		  organised into four main sections:
		  
		  * **Programming In R** starts with how to obtain and
		  install R (for Windows, MacOS, and Unix platforms), then
		  tackles basic calculations and program flow, before
		  progressing to function based programming, data structures,
		  graphics, and object-oriented code * **A Primer on
		  Numerical Mathematics** introduces concepts of numerical
		  accuracy and program efficiency in the context of
		  root-finding, integration, and optimization * **A
		  Self-contained Introduction to Probability Theory** takes
		  readers as far as the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the
		  Central Limit Theorem, equipping them for point and
		  interval estimation * **Simulation **teaches how to
		  generate univariate random variables, do Monte-Carlo
		  integration, and variance reduction techniques
		  
		  In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced
		  using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory
		  management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested
		  pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous
		  examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects.
		  Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the
		  application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how
		  to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to
		  make tools, not just use them.
		  
		  \#\#\# Review
		  
		  This book is a good resource for someone who wants to learn
		  R and use R for statistical computing and graphics. It will
		  also serve well as a textbook or a reference book for
		  students in a course related to computational statistics.
		  —Hon Keung Tony Ng, *Technometrics*, May 2011
		  
		  … a very coherent and useful account of its chosen
		  subject matter. … The programming section … is more
		  comprehensive than Braun \& Murdoch (2007), but more
		  accessible than Venables \& Ripley (2000). … The book
		  deserves a place on university library shelves … One very
		  useful feature of the book is that nearly every chapter has
		  a set of exercises. There are also plenty of well-chosen
		  examples throughout the book that are used to explain the
		  material. I also appreciated the clear and attractive
		  programming style of the R code presented in the book. I
		  found very little in the way of typos or solecisms. … I
		  can strongly recommend the book for its intended audience.
		  If I ever again have to teach our stochastic modelling
		  course, I will undoubtedly use some of the exercises and
		  examples from **Scientific Programming and Simulation Using
		  R**. —David Scott, *Australian \& New Zealand Journal of
		  Statistics*, 2011
		  
		  It is not often that I think that a statistics text is one
		  that most scientifc statisticians should have in their
		  personal libraries. **Introduction to Scientific
		  Programming and Simulation Using R** is such a text. …
		  This text provides scientific researchers with a working
		  knowledge of R for both reviewing and for engaging in the
		  statistical evaluation of scientific data. …It is
		  particularly useful for understanding and developing
		  modeling and simulation software. I highly recommend the
		  text, finding it to be one of the most useful books I have
		  read on the subject. —*Journal of Statistical Software*,
		  September 2010, Volume 36
		  
		  The authors have written an excellent introduction to
		  scientific programming with R. Their clear prose, logical
		  structure, well-documented code and realistic examples made
		  the book a pleasure to read. One particularly useful
		  feature is the chapter of cases studies at the end, which
		  not only demonstrates complete analyses but also acts as a
		  pedagogical tool to review and integrate material
		  introduced throughout the book. … I would strongly
		  recommend this book for readers interested in using R for
		  simulations, particularly for those new to scientific
		  programming or R. It is also very student-friendly and
		  would be suitable either as a course textbook or for
		  self-study. —*Significance*, September 2009
		  
		  I think that the techniques of scientific programming
		  presented will soon enable the novice to apply statistical
		  models to real-world problems. The writing style is easy to
		  read and the book is suitable for private study. If you
		  have never read a book on scientific programming and
		  simulation, then I recommend that you start with this one.

		  *The Handbook of Rational and Social Choice* provides an
		  overview of issues arising in work on the foundations of
		  decision theory and social choice over the past three
		  decades. Drawing on work by economic theorists mainly, but
		  also with contributions from political science, philosophy
		  and psychology, the collection shows how the related areas
		  of decision theory and social choice have developed in
		  their applications and moved well beyond the basic models
		  of expected utility and utilitarian approaches to welfare
		  economics.
		  
		  Containing twenty-three contributions, in many cases by
		  leading figures in their fields, the handbook shows how the
		  normative foundations of economics have changed
		  dramatically as more general and explicit models of utility
		  and group choice have been developed. This is perhaps the
		  first time these developments have been brought together in
		  a manner that seeks to identify and make accessible the
		  recent themes and developments that have been of particular
		  interest to researchers in recent years. The collection
		  will be of particular value to researchers in economics
		  with interests in utility or welfare but it will also be of
		  interest to any social scientist or philosopher interested
		  in theories of rationality or group decision-making.

		  uses a variety of simple models to illuminate the economic
		  forces that bear on specific social security policy issues.
		  The focus is on the degree of progressivity desirable in
		  social security and the design of incentives to delay
		  retirement beyond the earliest age of eligibility for
		  benefits. Before analyzing these models, Diamond presents
		  introductions to optimal income tax theory and the theory
		  of incomplete markets. He incorporates recent theoretical
		  developments such as time-inconsistent preferences into his
		  analyses and shows that distorting taxes and a measure of
		  progressivity in benefits are desirable. Diamond also
		  discusses social security reform, with a focus on Germany.

  note		= "This book presents a wide array of methods applicable for
		  reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that
		  data. In addition to the built-in functions, a number of
		  readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R
		  Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods
		  presented take advantage of the core features of R:
		  vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the
		  proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided
		  for common data management tasks. Most experienced R users
		  discover that, especially when working with large data
		  sets, it may be helpful to use other programs, notably
		  databases, in conjunction with R. Accordingly, the use of
		  databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for
		  extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by
		  other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes
		  overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing
		  problems that are traditionally solved by scripting
		  languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users
		  with experience in other languages, guidelines for the
		  effective use of programming constructs like loops are
		  provided. Since many statistical modeling and graphics
		  functions need their data presented in a data frame,
		  techniques for converting the output of commonly used
		  functions to data frames are provided throughout the book.

		  Two alternative frameworks have traditionally been offered
		  to account for this relationship - methodological
		  individualism and methodological holism. The author upholds
		  four theses. First, these two alternatives are incapable of
		  accounting for all possible relationships between
		  microsociological regularities and macrosociological
		  generalizations. Second, there are at least three different
		  ways to formalize micro-macro relationships: parallelism,
		  localism and convergentism. Third, high-level and low-level
		  explanations provide radically different kinds of
		  information. Finally, the author explores a possible
		  naturalization of the debate. The article as a whole can be
		  read as a contribution to the problem of social complexity.

  note		= "**A complete guide to carrying out complex survey analysis
		  using R**
		  
		  As survey analysis continues to serve as a core component
		  of sociological research, researchers are increasingly
		  relying upon data gathered from complex surveys to carry
		  out traditional analyses. *Complex Surveys* is a practical
		  guide to the analysis of this kind of data using R, the
		  freely available and downloadable statistical programming
		  language. As creator of the specific survey package for R,
		  the author provides the ultimate presentation of how to
		  successfully use the software for analyzing data from
		  complex surveys while also utilizing the most current data
		  from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate the
		  application of survey research methods in these fields.
		  
		  The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics
		  within survey analysis such as simple and stratified
		  sampling, cluster sampling, linear regression, and
		  categorical data regression. Subsequent chapters delve into
		  more technical aspects of complex survey analysis,
		  including post-stratification, two-phase sampling, missing
		  data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, an
		  emphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and
		  two-phase designs. In addition, the author supplies a
		  unique discussion of epidemiological two-phase designs as
		  well as probability-weighting for causal inference. All of
		  the book's examples and figures are generated using R, and
		  a related Web site provides the R code that allows readers
		  to reproduce the presented content. Each chapter concludes
		  with exercises that vary in level of complexity, and
		  detailed appendices outline additional mathematical and
		  computational descriptions to assist readers with comparing
		  results from various software systems.
		  
		  *Complex Surveys* is an excellent book for courses on
		  sampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate and
		  graduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for
		  applied statisticians and practitioners in the social and
		  health sciences who use statistics in their everyday work.

  title		= "New Thinking in Complexity for the Social Sciences and
		  Humanities: A Generative, Transdisciplinary Approach",
  author	= "Ton Jörg",
  note		= "The underlying idea and motive for the book is that the
		  notion of complexity may humanize the social sciences, may
		  conceive the complex human being as more human, and turn
		  reality as assumed in our doing social science into a more
		  complex, that is a richer reality for all. The main focus
		  of this book is on new thinking in complexity, with
		  complexity to be taken as derived from the Latin word
		  complexus: ‘that which is interwoven.’ The
		  trans-disciplinary approach advocated here will be
		  trans-disciplinary in two ways: firstly, by going beyond
		  the separate disciplines within the fields of both natural
		  sciences and social sciences, and, secondly, by going
		  beyond the separate cultures of the natural sciences and of
		  the social sciences and humanities.
		  
		  \#\#\# From the Back Cover
		  
		  This book focuses on the development of new thinking in
		  complexity and on the tools needed for this new thinking,
		  i.e. the development of a new language for complexity. This
		  new language is very much about how a nonlinear complex
		  reality is part of real-world complexity. We can start
		  thinking in complexity about the complex topics of our
		  social sciences and humanities by making use of this new
		  language. With the new tools and the new language, it will
		  be possible to deal with the complexity of real-world
		  complexity and to show the promise of harnessing
		  complexity, by turning complexity into effective and
		  advantageous complexity for our social sciences and
		  humanities. It is the very potential of complexity as
		  self-potentiating which makes complexity so beneficial for
		  viewing and doing social sciences. The new tools and the
		  new thinking in complexity may be considered to be the warp
		  and woof of a new science of complexity.

  author	= "Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman",
  note		= "During the past decade there has been an explosion in
		  computation and information technology. With it have come
		  vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as
		  medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of
		  understanding these data has led to the development of new
		  tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas
		  such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
		  Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often
		  expressed with different terminology. This book describes
		  the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual
		  framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis
		  is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are
		  given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a
		  valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested
		  in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage
		  is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to
		  unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
		  networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
		  boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic
		  in any book. This major new edition features many topics
		  not covered in the original, including graphical models,
		  random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \&
		  path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix
		  factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a
		  chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n),
		  including multiple testing and false discovery rates.

		  equilibrium theory for advanced undergraduate and
		  graduate-level students of economics. It contains detailed
		  discussions of economic efficiency, competitive
		  equilibrium, the first and second welfare theorems, the
		  Kuhn-Tucker approach to general equilibrium, the
		  Arrow-Debreu model, and rational expectations equilibrium
		  and the permanent income hypothesis. Truman Bewley also
		  treats optimal growth and overlapping generations models as
		  special cases of the general equilibrium model. He uses the
		  model and the first and second welfare theorems to explain
		  the main ideas of insurance, capital theory, growth theory,
		  and social security. It enables him to present a unified
		  approach to portions of macro- as well as microeconomic
		  theory. The book contains problems sets for most chapters.

		  statistical computing environment. It has an excellent
		  collection of data manipulation and graphics capabilities.
		  It is extensible and comes with a large number of packages
		  that allow statistical analysis at all levels – from
		  simple to advanced – and in numerous fields including
		  Medicine, Genetics, Biology, Environmental Sciences,
		  Geology, Social Sciences and much more. The software is
		  maintained and developed by academicians and professionals
		  and as such, is continuously evolving and up to date.
		  *Statistics and Data with R* presents an accessible guide
		  to data manipulations, statistical analysis and graphics
		  using R.
		  
		  Assuming no previous knowledge of statistics or R, the book
		  includes:
		  
		  * A comprehensive introduction to the R language. * An
		  integrated approach to importing and preparing data for
		  analysis, exploring and analyzing the data, and presenting
		  results. * Over 300 examples, including detailed
		  explanations of the R scripts used throughout. * Over 100
		  moderately large data sets from disciplines ranging from
		  Biology, Ecology and Environmental Science to Medicine,
		  Law, Military and Social Sciences. * A parallel discussion
		  of analyses with the normal density, proportions
		  (binomial), counts (Poisson) and bootstrap methods. * Two
		  extensive indexes that include references to every R
		  function (and its arguments and packages used in the book)
		  and to every introduced concept.
		  
		  An accompanying Wiki website, http://turtle.gis.umn.edu
		  includes all the scripts and data used in the book. The
		  website also features a solutions manual, providing answers
		  to all of the exercises presented in the book. Visitors are
		  invited to download/upload data and scripts and share
		  comments, suggestions and questions with other visitors.
		  Students, researchers and practitioners will find this to
		  be both a valuable learning resource in statistics and R
		  and an excellent reference book.
