@article{VanDerHeijden1998,
abstract = {We experimentally investigate the argument that the establishment and maintenance of an intergenerational transfer system is related to cross-generational monitoring. In our overlapping-generations experiment transfers are induced to be collectively efficient, but individually suboptimal. Varying the information conditions allows us to study the relationship between the level and development of voluntary transfers, on the one hand, and the possibility for cross-generational monitoring and rewarding and punishing, on the other hand. The experimental results give little support for the importance of monitoring. Nevertheless, a fairly efficient level of transfers is observed. The results suggest that the public good feature of the setting is more important than the bargaining feature, which would require intertemporal rewards and punishments.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we carry out computational experiments to examine the Japanese public pension system from the perspective of both the macro and micro levels. In Japan, one of the most aging populations in the world, many studies have been conducted using computational simulations to evaluate the sustainability of the pension system under the condition of drastic demographic change. Although most of those studies including a governmental valuation of the pension system mainly focus on the macro-level outputs of simulations, they pay little attention to individuals in the pension system. In order to obtain the micro data of individuals, we develop an agent-based model for the Japanese public pension system using actual statistical data sets adopted from surveys by the Japanese government. In this chapter, we present the development of our simulation model and discuss the effectiveness of an agent-based approach to examine the pension scheme through our simulation results.},

@unpublished{Borsch-supan2005,
abstract = {Population aging and pension reform will have profound effects on international capital markets. First, demographic change alters the time path of aggregate savings within each country. Second this process may be amplified when a pension reform shifts old-age provision towards more pre-funding. Third, while the patterns of population aging are similar in most counries, timing and initial conditions differ substantially. Hence, to the extent that capital is internationally mobile, population aging will induce capital flows between countries. All three effects influence the rate of return to capital and interact with the demand for capital in production and with labor supply. In order to quantify these effects, we develop a computational general equilibrium model. We feed this multi-country overlapping generations model with detailed long-term demographic projections for seven world regions. Our simulations indicate that capital flows from fast-aging regions to the rest of the world will initially be substantial but that trends are reversed when households decumulate savings. We also conclude that closed-economy models of pension reform miss quantitatively important effects of international capital mobility.},

A mixed-method, longitudinal study examined turnover in a sample of 261 personal support workers in Maine; 70 workers (26.8{\%}) left their employment in the first year of the study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age and lack of health insurance were significant predictors of turnover. Analysis of telephone interviews revealed three overarching themes related to termination: job not worthwhile, personal reasons, and burnout. Implications of study findings for gerontological social workers are outlined.},

The paper develops a compound index of private pension provision based on a number of quantifiable variables (theoretical replacement rates of public plans, assets of funded pension schemes, private pension expenditure and coverage by private pension plans) that tries to tap into these different aspects. It can be used to empirically categorize the extent to which Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ({\{}OECD){\}} countries have privatized their pension provision.},

abstract = {This article introduces microsimulation by presenting its main underlying ideas as well as its main strengths and drawbacks. Microsimulation is currently experiencing a boom, which is driven by three main forces. The first is the increased demand of policy makers for detailed projections and models able to assess distributional and long-term sustainability issues of social security systems. The second is the emergence of new research paradigms with an increased emphasis on individuals within their context, studied from a longitudinal, multilevel perspective. The third concerns technological advances, providing not only the necessary computer power but also the programming tools for model development, accessible to scientists without specialized programming skills. Although static microsimulation models are established tools for policy analysis, dynamic microsimulation has yet to find its way into the methodological toolbox of mainstream social scientists—but the prospects are promising.},

abstract = {We explore the benefits of intergenerational risk-sharing through both private funded pensions and via the public debt. We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation adjustment policies are substitutes and the same is the case for contribution and tax adjustment policies. By contrast, indexation and tax adjustment policies are complements. We compare different taxation regimes and conclude that a regime in which pension benefits are taxed, while contributions are paid before taxes, is preferred to a regime in which contributions are paid after taxes, but benefits are untaxed.

abstract = {Previous quantitative research regarding the long expansionary era of public pension generosity has relied mainly on aggregate expenditure data, which capture many pension policy dimensions. Yet, the overall level of national pension generosity may differ from the generosity of each important dimension. To improve our understanding of public pension reforms that increase generosity levels, this study examines the introduction of automatic indexation clauses between 1945 and 2000. The paper tests predictions of welfare policy development and policy diffusion theories. Using event history methods, we argue that the inflation rate and the incumbency of Christian democratic parties are the main determinants of these policy reforms. Countries with higher inflation rates and more entrenched Christian democratic parties are more likely to link pensions in payment or past wages considered for initial calculation purposes to an economic index. This suggests that political parties differ in their support for each measure that improves pension generosity depending on its expected redistributive impact.},

Using a game-theoretical model, we show that a government enacts reforms that are unpopular with the median voter during bad economic times, but not during good ones. The key reason is that voters cannot commit to re-elect a government that does not reform during bad times. This voters' commitment problem stems from economic voting, i.e., voters' tendency to punish the government for a poorly performing economy. The voter commitment problem provides an explanation for the empirical puzzle that governments sometimes enact reforms that voters oppose.},

We find that this latest reforms, which extend the number of years os contributions used to compute the pensions, delay the retirement ages, introduce two sustainability factors, and effectively transform the Spanish pay-as-you- go system into a defined-contribution system, succeed in making Spanish pensions sustainable until 2037, but they fail to do so afterwards. The success until 2037 is achieved reducing the real value of the average pension and leaving the many loopholes of the contributivity and the transparency of the system unchanged. This reduction in pensions is progressive and, by 2037, the average pension will be approximately 20 percent smaller in real terms than what it would have been under the pension rules prevailing in 2010. The 2013 pension reform fails after 2037 because, from that year onwards, approximately 50 percent of the Spanish retirees will be paid the minimum pension, which is exempt from the sustainability factors. We conjecture that further reforms lurk in the future of Spanish pensions. Keywords:},

abstract = {What makes humans moral beings? This question can be understood either as a proximate “how” question or as an ultimate “why” question. The “how” question is about the mental and social mechanisms that produce moral judgments and interactions, and has been investigated by psychologists and social scientists. The “why” question is about the fitness consequences that explain why humans have morality, and has been discussed by evolutionary biologists in the context of the evolution of cooperation. Our goal here is to contribute to a fruitful articulation of such proximate and ultimate explanations of human morality. We develop an approach to morality as an adaptation to an environment in which individuals were in competition to be chosen and recruited in mutually advantageous cooperative interactions. In this environment, the best strategy is to treat others with impartiality and to share the costs and benefits of cooperation equally. Those who offer less than others will be left out of cooperation; conversely, those who offer more will be exploited by their partners. In line with this mutualistic approach, the study of a range of economic games involving property rights, collective actions, mutual help and punishment shows that participants' distributions aim at sharing the costs and benefits of interactions in an impartial way. In particular, the distribution of resources is influenced by effort and talent, and the perception of each participant's rights on the resources to be distributed.},

abstract = {We study the effects of pension reform in a four-period OLG model for an open economy where hours worked by three active generations, education of the young, the retirement decision of older workers, and aggregate growth, are all endogenous. Within each generation we distinguish individuals with high, medium or low ability to build human capital. This extension allows to investigate also the effects of pension reform on the income and welfare levels of different ability groups. Particular attention goes to the income at old-age and the welfare level of low-ability individuals. Our simulation results prefer an intelligent pay-as-you-go pension system above a fully-funded private system. When it comes to promoting employment, human capital, growth, and aggregate welfare, positive effects in a pay-as-you-go system are the strongest when it includes a tight link between individual labor income (and contributions) and the pension, and when it attaches a high weight to labor income earned as an older worker to compute the pension assessment base. Such a regime does, however, imply welfare losses for the current low-ability generations, and rising inequality in welfare. Complementing or replacing this ‘intelligent' pay-as-you-go system by basic and/or minimum pension components is negative for aggregate welfare, employment and growth. Better is to maintain the tight link between individual labor income and the pension also for low-ability individuals, but to strongly raise their replacement rate.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for developing forecasts of future mortality rates. We discuss the suitability of six stochastic mortality models for forecasting future mortality and estimating the density of mortality rates at different ages. In particular, the models are assessed individually with reference to the following qualitative criteria that focus on the plausibility of their forecasts: biological reasonableness; the plausibility of predicted levels of uncertainty in forecasts at different ages; and the robustness of the forecasts relative to the sample period used to fit the model. An important, though unsurprising, conclusion is that a good fit to historical data does not guarantee sensible forecasts. We also discuss the issue of model risk, common to many modelling situations in demography and elsewhere. We find that even for those models satisfying our qualitative criteria, there are significant differences among central forecasts of mortality rates at different ages and among the distributions surrounding those central forecasts. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We use an overlapping-generations model with Beveridgean pay-as-you-go pensions and heterogeneous individuals who differ in ability and lifespan. We find that introducing flexible pension take-up can induce a Pareto improvement when the initial pension scheme contains within-cohort redis-tribution and induces early retirement. Such a Pareto improving reform entails the application of uniform actuarial adjustment of pension entitlements based on average lifespan. Introducing actuarial non-neutrality that stimulates later retirement further improves such a flexibility reform.},

On the basis of the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), we find that, for higher ages, an extension of the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD) model that incor- porates a cohort effect fits the England and Wales males data best, while for U.S. males data, the Renshaw and Haberman (RH) extension to the Lee and Carter model that also allows for a cohort effect provides the best fit. However, we identify problems with the robustness of parameter estimates under the RH model, calling into question its suitability for forecasting. A different ex- tension to the CBD model that allows not only for a cohort effect, but also for a quadratic age effect, while ranking below the other models in terms of the BIC, exhibits parameter stability across different time periods for both datasets. This model also shows, for both datasets, that there have been approximately linear improvements over time in mortality rates at all ages, but that the improvements have been greater at lower ages than at higher ages, and that there are significant cohort effects.},

Two cities in the State of Yucatan, Valladolid (treatment) and Motul (control), were selected for the income supplementation experiment. Elderly residents of Valladolid were provided the equivalent of an additional {\$}67 per month, a 44{\%} increase in average household income. We designed a survey given to residents of both cities before and 6 mo after the income supplement about their health and other aspects of overall well-being. Both baseline and follow-up surveys collect self-reported data on health, physical functioning, and biomarkers. Anthropometric measurements for every age-eligible respondent, including height, weight, and waist circumference, were collected. We also collected lung capacity, grip strength, a series of balance tests, and a timed walk. Our results show significant health benefits associated with the additional income. Relative to the control site, there was a statistically significant improvement in lung function and an improvement in memory. These improvements are equivalent to a reduction in age of 5-10 y. Residents used their extra income to go to the doctor, buy their medications, and alleviate their hunger. The fear that this extra income could be undone by reduced transfers from other family members or unwise expenditures by the poor elderly appears to be unfounded.},

abstract = {The BRICS countries have made important prog- ress in extending social security coverage. However, much remains to be achieved to realize the goal of comprehensive universal social security protection. Using policy experiences from the BRICS, the article explores the possibility of drawing from existing models of social security provision to design effective policy interventions for universalizing social security. Main principles of a framework for bridging the coverage gap are identified. These principles are then placed in complimen- tary and supplementary relationships to develop a framework for policy interventions to bridge the social security coverage gap and achieve universal social security.},

The programs were designed to inform people about risk diversification, an essential concept for financial decisionmaking. The effectiveness of these programs was evaluated using the RAND American Life Panel. Participants were exposed to one of the programs, and then asked to answer questions measuring financial literacy and self-efficacy. All of the programs were found to be effective at increasing self-efficacy, and several improved financial literacy, providing new evidence for the value of programs designed to help individuals make financial decisions. The video was more effective at improving financial literacy scores than the written narrative, highlighting the power of online media in financial education.},

abstract = {When pension systems are contrasted it is common to use simplified demographic models, such as overlapping generation models with time-invariant mortality. Breaking with this tradition, we show that for a population with increasing longevity, the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system may be more advantageous than a funded system (FS). Increasing longevity favours the PAYG system because for the workers living longer at retirement than current retirees, it is less costly to fund others' current pensions than their own. At present, the effect amounts to around 15 per cent in terms of the dependency ratio, or six more years at work in the FS, or 1 per cent per annum in terms of the real interest rate. In most developed countries the effect substantially exceeds that of the usually studied biological interest rate.},

(ii) What are the economic and political interactions between social security systems and other redistributive programs of the welfare state? (iii) How does political sustainability shape social security systems in a dynamic economic and demographic environment, and which social security reforms are politically feasible? We characterize this literature along two lines: economic factors and political institutions. We then assess the empirical relevance of the models by comparing their implications to stylized social security facts. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{OECD2015,
abstract = {The theme of this fourth edition of Pensions at a Glance is pensions, retirement and life expectancy. Many countries have increased pension ages in the face of population ageing and longer lives. Some have introduced an automatic link between pensions and life expectancy. Improvements to the incentives to work rather than retire are also a common part of recent pension-reform packages. However, ensuring that there are enough jobs for older workers remains a challenge. An in-depth look at these important policy issues is provided by five special chapters on: pension ages, retirement behaviour, pension incentives to retire, the demand for older workers and linking pensions to life expectancy. This edition updates information on the key features of pension provision in OECD countries and provides projections of retirement income for todays workers. It offers an expanded range of 34 indicators, covering the design of national retirement-income provision, pension entitlements, incomes of older people, the finances of pension systems, the demographic and economic context in which pension systems operate and private pensions. More countries are analysed than in previous editions, including four new members of the OECD: Chile, Estonia, Israel and Slovenia. Where possible, data are also provided for the other major economies in the G20: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Along with data on the European Unions 27 member states, this brings to 43 the number of economies covered in the report. About Pensions at a Glance... "An extraordinarily useful and careful compilation of pension information for a wide-range of countries, presented in a common format and following a thoughtful structure. The authors have brought cross-national pension comparisons to a new level, and they are to be commended for their intensive efforts. This represents some of the smartest comparative work out there, by people intimately familiar with the nuances and complexities of comparative pension work." - Olivia Mitchell, Director of the Boettner Centre for Pensions and Retirement Research, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania},

abstract = {This paper undertakes an assessment of a rapidly growing body of economic research on financial literacy. We start with an overview of theoretical research, which casts financial knowledge as a form of investment in human capital. Endogenizing financial knowledge has important implications for welfare, as well as policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the least financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed by an examination of the impact of financial literacy on economic decision making in the United States and elsewhere. While the literature is still young, conclusions may be drawn about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and what works to remedy these gaps. A final section offers thoughts on what remains to be learned if researchers are to better inform theoretical and empirical models as well as public policy},

We argue that doing so has helped fixed deficiencies with standard approaches to modeling the economy-for example, the counterfactual absence of inertia in the standard New Keynesian model of economic fluctuations. We survey efforts to use behavioral economics to improve some of the underpinnings of the New Keynesian model-specifically, consumption, the formation of expectations and determination of wages and employment that underlie aggregate supply, and the possibility of multiple equilibria and asset price bubbles. We also discuss more broadly the advantages and disadvantages of using behavioral economics features in macroeconomic models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Within the pension block we model both the first pension pillar, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the fully-funded second pillar of the Slovenian pension system. The modelling of the first pension pillar is based on cash flows of the mandatory pension insurance institution, the relationship between the pension base and the pension, and the process of harmonising pension growth to wage growth. The modelling of the second pillar centres on implementation of the liquidity constraint. Use was made of supplementary pension profiles, and the ratio between premia paid and pensions paid out from supplementary pension insurance. The category of total pension was also introduced, and the model ensured that at every point households adjusted the scope of labour supply and their current consumption towards the target total pension.

This choice problem is common in several countries that have reformed their social security system in the last decades. Although with some specific features, such process is currently affecting private sector em- ployees in Italy, since the reform of the TFR mechanism in 2007. This reform basically allows workers to choose between a scheme directly managed by the firms and an external defined contribution scheme. In their decision workers not only have to weight out the different pros and cons that different schemes offer but they also have to consider the effect that their choice exerts on the financial structure of the firm they work in. Once we have formalized this decision problem, we carry out some simulations in order to replicate the Italian data and to shed some light on the outcomes of the Italian reform.},

abstract = {Many European countries have seen a retrenchment in public social policies over recent decades due to fiscal restrictions and demographic changes. Welfare states are in flux and non-state social policy is promoted in a large number of countries in order to cope with these challenges. In changing welfare states, occupational welfare represents a very important potential compen-sation for retrenchment (Trampusch, 2009). Although the comparative welfare state literature has improved our understanding of retrenchment processes (Obinger et al., 2010; Schludi, 2005; Seeleib-Kaiser, 2008), these studies have focused on public pensions and countries Abstract Studies analysing welfare have previously focused on countries as units. In the course of pension cuts and the increasing importance of occupational welfare, our traditional understanding of a homogeneous welfare state is being challenged. In this article, I distinguish between both economic individual power (employee skills) and political collective power (trade unions), and their relation with different occupational pensions. A combined analysis by both factors is not common, where employee skills and power resources are traditionally treated as separate, rival explanations of public welfare. Combining the 'method of difference' with the 'method of agreement', the article first presents the within-country variety of occupational pensions in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Denmark. Occupational pensions in the same economic sectors across countries are then used as the units of analysis in order to illustrate the plausible determinants of economic individual power and political collective power.},

abstract = {Female old age poverty is affected by family policy reforms which are meant to promote gender equality when young. Using our in house agent based simulation model IFSIM we show that sharing equally the parental leave can increase or reduce poverty among elderly women depending on the macro and behavioural (i.e. labour supply) responses that the reform off-sets. In general, the reform can be good for highly educated women, who will have an incentive to work more full time thanks to their higher earnings, which can compensate any loss in household income due to the man's staying home. For lower educated however, work might not pay as much and a reduction in labour supply might actually ensue (e.g. to reduce childcare costs). This will reduce also their pension rights at retirement. Furthermore, keeping men at home might slow down economic growth, and consequently growth of income pension accounts will be lower. This effect, combined with lower pension contributions (due to reduced labour supply), might result in higher poverty rates for women with lower education, compared to a scenario where the woman takes the whole leave. Other policies, such as more subsidised child care, might be an alternative worth considering to reduce female poverty in old age more evenly across educational levels. ?? 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.},

abstract = {In this article we formulate and solve the optimal design problem of a defined contribution public pension fund, in a highly stylized but still rather general non-stationary framework. We adopt the viewpoint of a benevolent social planner who aims at treating in a fair manner the successive overlapping generations participating to such a long-term mandatory system. Using the approach of El Karoui and Jeanblanc (1998) for the optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem with random income in a complete market, we exhibit a solution to our intertemporal stochastic control problem where each generation receives a fair (lumpsum) retirement benefit: it is proportional to the contributions she has paid during her active worklife and follows a fixed common rule (although her pension value itself may depend on variables only observable at her retirement time). We next relax the assumption that the collective pension system is mandatory and investigate the performance of individual investment plans in the market. Comparing the outcomes of both alternatives, we derive a condition under which the collective fund can be expected to overperform the individual plan. In the special case of a stationary economy, such a possibility has been pointed out by Gollier (2008). In fact this effect results from the possibility for the collective fund to borrow today against contributions of future generations, which allows to implement riskier strategies and may improve its performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {This paper examines the motives underlying inter vivos transfers within the family. Moving away from the altruism and exchange hypotheses, we study the endogenous altruism approach in which private transfers are rooted in a purposeful shaping of preferences within the family. Rather than relying on the demonstration effect theory where parents take care of their elders in order to elicit a similar behaviour from their children, we present instead a model of cultural transmission of altruistic values between generations in which individuals can be either altruistic or nonaltruistic with respect to their parents. The predictions of the model are empirically tested using French data that allow us to investigate time-related transfers and attention from middle-aged respondents to their elders. The empirical results are in favour of the cultural transmission of altruism, in that people who support their parents are more likely to be supported by their children. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Alternative pension schemes, and early retirement provisions in particular, can produce different effects on retirement behavior, with significant economic consequences. This paper presents new evidence on the effect of different seniority pension reforms, considering the evolution of an agent-based economy in Italy, with heterogeneous workers whose retirement age depends on expected lifetime incomes. Using dynamic aging methods, we examine behavioral changes along proposed pension reform paths. Our model calibrated to replicate the main demographic and economic features and retirement dynamics of the Italian economy - is used to estimate the age of retirement, total pension expenditures, pension benefits and the trend of inequality and poverty among pensioners under different policy scenarios. More precisely, we compare the current state of affairs (B) with a reform proposed by the Italian Welfare Minister (M) and with an early introduction of a mixed regime for seniority pensions (A) according to two limiting "retirement behavioral rules." Under the individual rationality hypothesis, M produces slightly higher savings with minor redistributive effects; although it leads to an increase in income concentration, M mitigates poverty problems after 2008. The reform is more effective under family-bounded rationality, but it leads to permanent and more significant increases in income concentration and aggravates the diffusion and intensity of poverty.},

We conclude that Three Worlds has become a classic that is likely to continue to have a major influence on welfare state research in its next 25 years.},

abstract = {This study analyses the dynamics of a general equilibrium, overlapping-generations (closed) economy with pay-as-you-go public pensions and tax-financed health investments that affect the retirement time when old. Life of the typical agent is divided between youth (firth period) and old age (second period). The latter period of life is, in turn, divided between work time and retirement time in a proportion contingent on an individual's state of health. We show that: (i) a unique non-trivial steady state exists, and (ii) when the labour income tax rates used to finance health expenditure or public pensions are included in an intermediate range of values, complex dynamics occur when individuals have perfect foresight. This holds because the increase either in the fraction of time spent working when old or disability pensions reduces savings and capital accumulation. In addition, dynamic phenomena such as multiple bubbling structures related to the bifurcation diagram can be observed. Under some general assumptions, we show that the rise in health care expenditure and/or public pensions initially destabilises the steady-state equilibrium and causes complex dynamics but eventually acts as a stabilising device.},

Using longitudinal microdata on Australian pensioners, we quantify the extent of longevity selection at both aggregate and scheme level. We also show that as the age-membership structure in a pension scheme matures, scheme-specific longevity selection risk and systematic shocks become quantitatively more important and have larger consequences for plan liabilities than aggregate selection risk or the impact of mortality improvements.},

abstract = {The explanatory model behind Esping-Andersen's ‘three-regime' typology points to the variance in ‘political coalition building in the transition from a rural economy to a middle-class society', particularly to whether or not farmers and workers were able to form coalitions during this transition. The article reconsiders the relation between party systems and welfare state regimes. It highlights the systematic variation among European party systems with respect to the electoral success of communist parties. The electoral strength of communist parties is argued to be related to the intensity of past conflicts between the nation-state and the Catholic church in the mono-denominational countries of Europe's south. These conflicts rendered a coalition between pious farmers and the anticlerical worker's movement unthinkable and furthered the radicalization of the left. The article argues that the split on the left explains much of what is distinctive about southern Europe's postwar political economies. },

abstract = {We argue that the welfare state operates very differently in the advanced sectors of modern economies and in the low-skill sectors. Governments are concerned to promote the advanced sectors of their economies in which they have comparative advantage. This is a valence issue not a partisan one. Where companies and employees in advanced sectors co-invest heavily in company-specific skills, then governments will be concerned to maintain insurance infrastructures to underwrite these investments. Hence, in advanced sectors, we see politics for markets in maintaining insurance-based welfare states. In low-skill sectors, redistribution and active labour market policies are partisan issues for legislatures, so here our analysis is in line with Politics against Markets. Effective welfare state policies depend on political coalitions in which the low-skilled are represented. We suggest that those coalitions may be less available just as low-skilled workers are increasingly excluded from post-Fordist collective bargaining coverage. Keywords},

abstract = {Redistribution is an inevitable feature of collective pension schemes and economic experiments have revealed that most people have a preference for redistribution that is not merely inspired by self-interest. However, little is known on how these preferences interact with preferences for different pension schemes. In this paper, we review the experimental evidence on preferences for redistribution and suggest some links to redistribution through pensions. For that purpose we distinguish between three types of situations. The first deals with distributional preferences behind a veil of ignorance. In the second type of situation, individuals make choices in front of the veil of ignorance and know their position. Finally, we discuss situations in which income is determined by interdependent rather than individual choices. In the closing sections of the paper, we discuss whether and how these experimental results speak to the redistribution issues of pensions. For example, do they argue for or against mandatory participation? Should we have less redistribution and more actuarial fairness? How does this depend on the type of redistribution involved?},

abstract = {This study analyses the actuarial characteristics of the Italian pension system throughout its transition from defined benefit (DB) to notional defined contribution (NDC) rules, taking into account expected increasing longevity. Computations rely on ad hoc projected cohort mortality tables based on a limit survival scenario depicted by demographic experts. Most workers retiring in the coming years, whose pension is partly computed according to DB rules, will receive more-than-actuarially fair pensions. However, the generosity of the pension system has been significantly reduced for them by a recent reform that tightened early retirement eligibility requirements. Disability benefits remain (extremely) generous when claimed before age (57) 60. Steady-state NDC pensions, due to dynamic efficiency, are less than actuarially fair. They further deviate from actuarial fairness due to the specific rules, based on historical mortality, adopted by the Italian law for computing and updating benefits while facing increasing longevity. Cohort mortality projections should be used to handle longevity changes in NDC schemes.},

Using an agent-based model (ABM), it analyzes the characteristics of agents in the CPS regarding their articulation to the labour market and population dynamics; they whom assume one of the roles in the pension system in order to achieve their pen- sion. The odds for agents to adopt a regime are conditioned by the characteristics of the pension system and economical, social and political system variables which can change along with the evolution of the pension system, due to collective actions of agents and public policy decisions.},

@article{Halla2010,
abstract = {Does the supply of a welfare state create its own demand? Many economic scholars studying welfare arrangements refer to Say's law and insinuate a self-destructive welfare state. However, little is known about the empirical validity of these assumptions and hypotheses. We study the dynamic effect of different welfare arrangements on benefit fraud. In particular, we analyze the impact of the welfare state on the respective social norm, i.e. benefit morale. It turns out that a high level of public social expenditures and a high unemployment rate are associated with a small positive (or no) immediate impact on benefit morale, which however is (partly) crowded out by adverse medium and long run effects. In contrast to earlier studies we do not find that younger birth cohorts have lower values of benefit morale.
