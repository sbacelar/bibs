abstract = {Global matrices of bilateral migrant stocks spanning 1960-2000 are$\backslash$npresented, disaggregated by gender and based primarily on the foreign-born$\backslash$ndefinition of migrants. More than one thousand census and population$\backslash$nregister records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding$\backslash$nto the five census rounds between 1960 and 2000. For the first time,$\backslash$na comprehensive picture of bilateral global migration over the second$\backslash$nhalf of the 20th century emerges. The data reveal that the global$\backslash$nmigrant stock increased from 92 million in 1960 to 165 million in$\backslash$n2000. Quantitatively, migration between developing countries dominates,$\backslash$nconstituting half of all international migration in 2000. When the$\backslash$npartition of India and the dissolution of the Soviet Union are accounted$\backslash$nfor, migration between developing countries is remarkably stable$\backslash$nover the period. Migration from developing to developed countries$\backslash$nis the fastest growing component of international migration in both$\backslash$nabsolute and relative terms. The United States has remained the most$\backslash$nimportant migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of$\backslash$nthe world's migrants and the top destination for migrants from some$\backslash$n60 sending countries. Migration to Western Europe has come largely$\backslash$nfrom elsewhere in Europe. The oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge$\backslash$nas important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and North$\backslash$nAfrica and South and Southeast Asia. Finally, although the global$\backslash$nmigrant stock is predominantly male, the proportion of female migrants$\backslash$nincreased noticeably between 1960 and 2000. The number of women rose$\backslash$nin every region except South Asia.},

abstract = {The mix of products that a country exports predicts that country's subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries that export complex products— products that are exported by a few diversified countries—have lower levels of income inequality—at comparable levels of GDP per capita and education—than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate analysis we show that the connection between income inequality and economic complexity is stronger than what can be explained using aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital, and also, that increases in economic complexity are accompanied by decreases in income inequality over long periods of time. Finally, we use the position of a country in the network of related products—or product space—to explain how changes in a country's export structure translate into changes in income inequality. We interpret these results by combining the literature in institutions with that on economic complexity and structural transformations. We argue that the connection between income inequality and economic complexity is also evidence of the co-evolution between institutions and productive activities.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the bipartite network of countries and products from UN data on country production. We define the country-country and product-product projected networks and introduce a novel method of filtering information based on elements' similarity. As a result we find that country clustering reveals unexpected socio-geographic links among the most competing countries. On the same footings the products clustering can be efficiently used for a bottom-up classification of produced goods. Furthermore we mathematically reformulate the "reflections method" introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann as a fixpoint problem; such formulation highlights some conceptual weaknesses of the approach. To overcome such an issue, we introduce an alternative methodology (based on biased Markov chains) that allows to rank countries in a conceptually consistent way. Our analysis uncovers a strong non-linear interaction between the diversification of a country and the ubiquity of its products, thus suggesting the possible need of moving towards more efficient and direct non-linear fixpoint algorithms to rank countries and products in the global market.},

@article{Cristelli2013,
abstract = {We investigate a recent methodology we have proposed to extract valuable information on the competitiveness of countries and complexity of products from trade data. Standard economic theories predict a high level of specialization of countries in specific industrial sectors. However, a direct analysis of the official databases of exported products by all countries shows that the actual situation is very different. Countries commonly considered as developed ones are extremely diversified, exporting a large variety of products from very simple to very complex. At the same time countries generally considered as less developed export only the products also exported by the majority of countries. This situation calls for the introduction of a non-monetary and non-income-based measure for country economy complexity which uncovers the hidden potential for development and growth. The statistical approach we present here consists of coupled non-linear maps relating the competitiveness/fitness of countries to the complexity of their products. The fixed point of this transformation defines a metrics for the fitness of countries and the complexity of products. We argue that the key point to properly extract the economic information is the non-linearity of the map which is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them. We present a detailed comparison of the results of this approach directly with those of the Method of Reflections by Hidalgo and Hausmann, showing the better performance of our method and a more solid economic, scientific and consistent foundation.},

abstract = {What will be the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the competitiveness of China, United States, and Vietnam in the next 3, 5 or 10 years? Despite this kind of questions has a large societal impact and an extreme value for economic policy making, providing a scientific basis for economic predictability is still a very challenging problem. Recent results of a new branch--Economic Complexity--have set the basis for a framework to approach such a challenge and to provide new perspectives to cast economic prediction into the conceptual scheme of forecasting the evolution of a dynamical system as in the case of weather dynamics. We argue that a recently introduced non-monetary metrics for country competitiveness (fitness) allows for quantifying the hidden growth potential of countries by the means of the comparison of this measure for intangible assets with monetary figures, such as GDP per capita. This comparison defines the fitness-income plane where we observe that country dynamics presents strongly heterogeneous patterns of evolution. The flow in some zones is found to be laminar while in others a chaotic behavior is instead observed. These two regimes correspond to very different predictability features for the evolution of countries: in the former regime, we find strong predictable pattern while the latter scenario exhibits a very low predictability. In such a framework, regressions, the usual tool used in economics, are no more the appropriate strategy to deal with such a heterogeneous scenario and new concepts, borrowed from dynamical systems theory, are mandatory. We therefore propose a data-driven method--the selective predictability scheme--in which we adopt a strategy similar to the methods of analogues, firstly introduced by Lorenz, to assess future evolution of countries.},

abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

In this review I present an effort to mutually translate the work conducted by scholars from both of these academic fronts hoping to continue to unify what has become a diverging body of literature. I argue that social and natural scientists fail to see eye to eye because they have diverging academic goals. Social scientists focus on explaining how context specific social and economic mechanisms drive the structure of networks and on how networks shape social and economic outcomes. By contrast, natural scientists focus primarily on modeling network characteristics that are independent of context, since their focus is to identify universal characteristics of systems instead of context specific mechanisms. In the following pages I discuss the differences between both of these literatures by summarizing the parallel theories advanced to explain link formation and the applications used by scholars in each field to justify their approach to network science. I conclude by providing an outlook on how these literatures can be further unified. Introduction:},

For the purpose of modeling and analysis, we utilize finite state nonhomogeneous Markov chains to handle the migration.

@article{Pietronero2013,
abstract = {In this paper we provide a summary and a guide to the literature for a new line of research which goes under the name of Economic Complexity and is partly performed in collaboration with INET. This line of research portrays economic growth as an evolutive process of ecosystems of technologies and industrial capabilities. Complex systems analysis, simulation, systems science methods, and big data capabilities offer new opportunities to empirically map technology and capability ecosystems of countries and industrial sectors, analyse their structure, understand their dynamics and measure economic complexity. This approach provides a new perspective for data-driven fundamental economics in a strongly connected, globalised world. In particular here we discuss how it is possible to assess the competitiveness of country and complexity of products starting from the archival data on export flows that is the COMTRADE dataset which provides the matrix of countries and their exported products. According to the standard economic theory the specialization of countries towards certain specific products should be optimal. The observed data show that this is not the case and that diversification is actually more important. Specialization may be the leading effect in a static situation but the strongly dynamic and globalized world market suggests instead that flexibility and adaptability are essential elements of competitiveness as in bio-systems. The crucial challenge is therefore how these qualitative observations can be turned into quantitative variables. We have introduced a new metrics for the Fitness of countries and the Complexity of products which corresponds to the fixed point of the iteration of two nonlinear coupled equations. The nonlinearity is a key feature because it translates in mathematical terms the fact that the upper bound on the Complexity of a product must be mainly given by the less developed country able to produce it. The information provided by the new metrics can be used in several ways. As an example, the direct comparison of the Fitness with the country GDP per capita (Fitness-Income Plane) gives an assessment of the non-expressed potential of growth of a country. This can be used as a predictor of GDP evolution or stock index and sectors perfomances. The global dynamic in the Fitness-Income Plane reveals, however, a large degree of heterogeneity which implies that countries can evolve with different level of predictability according to the specific zone of the Fitness-Income plane they belong to. This heterogeneous dynamics is often disregarded in usual economic analysis. When dealing with heterogeneous systems, in fact, the usual tools of linear regressions become inappropriate. Making reliable predictions of growth in the context of economic complexity will then require a paradigm shift in order to catch the information contained in the complex dynamic patterns observed. These methods and concepts can give concrete contributions, as other possible applications, to risk analysis, investment opportunities analysis, policy-modelling of country growth and industrial planning.},

abstract = {Whilst the literature on international migration expands at a seemingly exponential rate, significant statements about the theorisation of migration are much less common; probably they are hindered by the increasing diversification of types of migration. This paper first reviews the various types of migration, and emphasises the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the study and theorisation of migration. In the main part of the paper I provide a personalised overview of theories of international migration, divided into the following sections: push-pull theory and the neoclassical approach; migration and development transitions; historical-structural and political economy models; the role of systems and networks; the ‘new economics' of migration; and finally approaches based on the ‘transnational turn' in migration studies. In the conclusion I point up some future challenges to theorising migration: the need to embed the study of migration within global processes of social, economic and political transformation and within the biographies of migrants' lifecourses; the importance of also explaining why people do not migrate, and the notion of access to mobility as a differentiating factor of class and inequality; and the relevance of existential and emotional dimensions of migration. The paper is explicitly aimed at a student audience and is intended as a primer to understanding some of the complexities and challenges of theorising migration.},

abstract = {The governance of international migration is particularly difficult because many actors are involved and their actions and local and global interactions may have cascading effects throughout the migration system and major consequences in sending and receiving countries. Unforeseen events contribute to the complexity. Successful governance of international migration depends on the ability to identify, understand and predict the actors and their interactions, and to anticipate the consequences for migration and society. International migration has many features of a complex system. Complexity science offers a comprehensive conceptual and analytical framework for the study and management of complex system. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the implementation of principles and methods of complexity science in international migration research and governance. Many people in the world longing for a better life consider emigration. Few do emigrate. The main features of the multi-stage decision process are captured in a model that operationalizes Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour and reproduces characteristic migration patterns at the population level. Migration policies help shape the geography of opportunities and barriers. An agent-based model is used to translate decision processes, including responses to policies, into individual migration histories. Aggregation of individual histories reveals characteristic patterns of migration and population change.},

abstract = {We provide a model to investigate the tension between information aggregation and spread of misinformation in large societies (conceptualized as networks of agents communicating with each other). Each individual holds a belief represented by a scalar. Individuals meet pairwise and exchange information, which is modeled as both individuals adopting the average of their pre-meeting beliefs. When all individuals engage in this type of information exchange, the society will be able to effectively aggregate the initial information held by all individuals. There is also the possibility of misinformation, however, because some of the individuals are "forceful," meaning that they influence the beliefs of (some) of the other individuals they meet, but do not change their own opinion. The paper characterizes how the presence of forceful agents interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even forceful agents obtain some information (however infrequent) from some others (and additional weak regularity conditions), we first show that beliefs in this class of societies converge to a consensus among all individuals. This consensus value is a random variable, however, and we characterize its behavior. Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation in the society by either providing bounds or exact results (in some special cases) on how far the consensus value can be from the benchmark without forceful agents (where there is efficient information aggregation). The worst outcomes obtain when there are several forceful agents and forceful agents themselves update their beliefs only on the basis of information they obtain from individuals most likely to have received their own information previously.},

We firstly compare the topological structure of worldwide networks of human migration and bilateral trade over the period 1960-2000. Next, we ask whether the position of any pair of countries in the migration network affects their bilateral trade flows. We show that: (i) both weighted and binary versions of the networks of international migration and trade are strongly correlated; (ii) such correlations can be mostly explained by country economic/demographic size and geographical distance; and (iii) pairs of countries that are more central in the international-migration network trade more. Our findings suggest that bilateral trade between any two countries is not only affected by the presence of migrants from either countries but also by their relative embeddedness in the complex web of corridors making up the network of international human migration.},

abstract = {Classical economic theories prescribe specialization of countries industrial production. Inspection of the country databases of exported products shows that this is not the case: successful countries are extremely diversified, in analogy with biosystems evolving in a competitive dynamical environment. The challenge is assessing quantitatively the non-monetary competitive advantage of diversification which represents the hidden potential for development and growth. Here we develop a new statistical approach based on coupled non-linear maps, whose fixed point defines a new metrics for the country Fitness and product Complexity. We show that a non-linear iteration is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them. We show that, given the paradigm of economic complexity, the correct and simplest approach to measure the competitiveness of countries is the one presented in this work. Furthermore our metrics appears to be economically well-grounded.},

This country-food production matrix can be: 1) transformed into overlap matrices which embed information regarding shared production of products among countries, and or shared countries for individual products, 2) identify subsets of countries which produce similar commodities or subsets of commodities shared by a given country allowing for visualization of correlations in large networks, and 3) used to rank country fitness (the ability to produce a diverse array of products weighted on the type of food commodities) and food specialization (quantified on the number of countries producing a specific food product weighted on their fitness). Our results show that, on average, countries with high fitness produce both low and high specializion food commodities, whereas nations with low fitness tend to produce a small basket of diverse food products, typically comprised of low specializion food commodities.},
